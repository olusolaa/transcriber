We saw that from the foundation of creation. When God created light, the Bible says, and God separated light from darkness. He called the light day and darkness night. And then we saw that the correct manifestation of grace in a man's life is the ability to say no to the ungodliness we find in the life of the ungodly. It is the grace of God that brings salvation as appeared unto all and it is teaching us to say no to worldly lust. So we saw... We noted in the month of August that it is very, very crucial for us to know that grace manifestation in a life is to say no to ungodliness and to live soberly godly life in this present world. So there is a life of the godly different from the life of the ungodly. A life that says no to worldly lust. And then we saw in the month of September, the matter of this unequal yoking, the need to run away from it, particularly when it has to do with sexual purity. That one area where the enemy is causing so much unequal yoking today, among many other areas, is the area... is the area of sexual purity. We have talked about the issue of indecent dressing, so many things that we have mentioned. But in the month of September, we were concerned much more than more about the issue of sexual purity for the believers. And we made it very clear that as far as God is concerned, all forms of sexual purity, all forms of sexual immorality, are something that is seriously anti-God. We saw that in a single day, God killed 24,000 in just a day because of sexual perversions coupled with idolatry. And then in the month of October, which was last month, we began to look at some important qualities we need to have. We saw that in the month of October, we saw the quality of integrity. Integrity and character. We were looking at the life of a quiet general. We looked at the life of a quiet general. And that was Uriah. We considered 1 Samuel chapter 11, verse 1 to the end. And from the life of Uriah, we saw that Uriah, and Uriah, and Uriah, and Uriah, and the things that happened between David and Beth Sheba, were able to draw important lessons to our lives. That it is very, very important for us that if we can notice this quality in the life of Uriah, and notice the mistakes on the part of David, and understand the scenario that surrounded Uriah, and I was able to stand for godliness in the whole situation. It becomes something for us to know how to stand against unequal yoking. For this month of November, we will be considering again another quiet general. Just for us to see that men had lived. Men who lived correct lives. Men who were able to stand the test of God. Men who were able to stand the test of time. There may be perversity and corruption everywhere. But I am telling you that there are some men. Deliberately, we are looking at men who does not seem to be so popular in scriptures. But men that we can learn great lessons from their lives. For this month of October, we want to look at something very important again. Eh? That, that can, that, that helps. Eh? That, that can, that, that helps. Against unequal yoking. In the life of the believer. Something that helps again. You know, it's seriously important. Vital. That can make us stand the test of time against all forms of perversity and unequal yoking in our time. We want to look at the life of Simon. Simon. Eh, eh, another, another general. Another general in the Bible. Quiet general again. Another quiet general. We have looked at a general in the Old Testament. We want to look at another general. Quiet general. In the New Testament. In the New Testament. And I would that we go to the book of Luke. Let's look at the life of this, of this man. He is blessed from his life to learn as something for us. So that we, we, we'll be able, we'll be able to stand, to stand tall and stand well in our work with God. Again, let's look at, eh, I wonder quite generally, Simon, let's go to Luke chapter 2. Let's take the reading from around verse, the early verse is there, from around verse, I want us to take it from verse, let's take it from verse 22. From verse 22, Luke chapter 2, let's take it from verse 22. We want to look at the life of this general, the episode around his own life. Now, when did they, I'm reading from the book of Luke chapter 22, chapter 2 from verse 22, sorry. Now, he says, When did they, I'm reading from the book of Luke chapter 22, chapter 2 from verse 22, sorry. Now, he says, Every day of our purification according to the law of Moses was completed. They brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. As it is written in the law of the Lord, every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord. And to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of thirty doves or two young pigeons. Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord Jesus Christ. Before he had seen the Lord Christ. So, he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom, of the law, he took him up in his arms and blessed him and said, Lord, now let, now you are letting your servant depart in peace according to your word. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared before the face of all people. A light to bring revelation to the Gentiles. A light to bring revelation to the Gentiles. And the glory of your people Israel. And Joseph and Mary, and Joseph and his mother, mother, are those things which were spoken of him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, Behold, this child is destined for the fall and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken. The number of Seraphim will now be shown, in that case, the Lord him work. What the whole earth cold will be shown and the migrating of flagship compassionate, holy Professional Olives, who will be seen as a nation Matthew, You and your heavens, why will you suffer in against? Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also, and the thoughts of many hearts, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. Praise the Lord. That's the reason that we want to consider for today, the life of this quiet general again in the New Testament. And I trust the Lord has given such a name to up trade for our nation, that they don't have any name for, much like we've been likened to the holy Word again, and they don't need to go to God as Jesus Christ. That's the reason I've been working hard on in 근데. So the word appears to, the\\\"!. That as we consider the life of this general, for those of us who are here physically and our young people and brethren connecting with us online, it will be a time of blessing in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us have a word of prayer. And we are praying that as we gather, let your spirit walk within us in the name of Jesus. Lord, I pray that everywhere we are located this morning, physically, online, different locations, Lord, I pray, meet us everywhere we are. In the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus. Let there be an entrance of your word in the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Eternal Father. Blessed be your holy name, our God. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. Now, we look into that scripture. And I would like to give a background. Something that, I did earlier, but for the purpose of our discussion again today, it might be good to give this background. We are looking at the life of the man, Simon. And we are looking at issues about this man. I want us to remember the historical situation or background issues or the life of this man. Like we said about Mary and Elizabeth the other time. This man too was in that same situation. Like we also said about Zachariah. That you must bear in mind that last time there was a clear prophetic voice in the land of Israel. That was distinct and clear was in Malachi. For hundreds of years, we are without such a definite voice. The spiritual and religious atmosphere was what we find looking at the life of the religious leaders in the days of Jesus. The Pharisees, the Sadducees and the Scribes. It was a time of serious spiritual blindness. It was a time when the mind of God was not clear to the people in the land. Even the so called religious leaders. They are just with the relics of the Jewish religion. Of the worship of God. The reality of that worship was not there. It was a time of just superficiality, artificiality and surface worship of God. It was not a time of personal intimate work with God. That was the religious climate. It was under the religious climate that we are situating Mary, we are situating Elizabeth, we are situating Zachariah and now we are also situating this quiet general, Simon. This quiet general. It was under that atmosphere. Now, in that atmosphere, Gabriel appeared to Mary and of course told Mary about Elizabeth like we said the last time. Mary went to visit Elizabeth and of course months later Elizabeth gave birth and of course months later too Mary gave birth and of course we found that when that happened while shepherds watched their flock by night Jesus was born the angel went to the shepherds to announce the birth of Jesus you will find all of that in the early part of that Luke chapter 2 but I just felt there is no need we read all of that because that is not our focus for today so the shepherds went just as the angel told them they saw the baby wrapped enclosed in a manger in a manger and then everything went they went to report all of that in the country and all of that and that was the story about the birth of Jesus the appearance of the angel to the shepherds and that episode went now the episode we are concerned with was the episode where Jesus when Jesus was to be presented in the temple and when he was presented in the temple that started in the verse 22 and like we read the bible says it was the day of her purification Mary was to purify herself according to the law of Moses because normally after birth it is believed that there is a kind of defilement because of everything that has to do with blood and so if the woman must come back to the temple the child will be presented the woman too will offer sacrifice for her own purification that was what Mary went to do in the temple to present Jesus according to the law too that if the child is a male then the child will be holy to the Lord to dedicate that child to the Lord so Joseph and Mary were in the temple for that exercise while that was going on the bible made reference in the verse 25 the bible said behold there was a man the introduction of Simon is something that brought our consideration look at the way it was introduced the bible says there was a man the introduction was not there was a priest the introduction was not there was a pastor it was not there was a bishop huh there was no sensation there was no showmanship there was no show it was among the ministers for that day it was not among the ministers because you must bear in mind that when they came for the purification Mary for her purification and for the presentation of Jesus in the temple there will be ministers that will take charge of that occasion for that day the priests the Levites and other religious folks that will be there they will all be there to undo that ceremony and so this man was not was not a part he was not part of the ministers for that day he was not among those that were called that's why the bible introduced him as a man he was just a man eh lessons that can help us to see that help men eh not you know to avoid unequal yoking not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers not to be lost in the perversity of their own time in the degeneration of their own society we are facing serious degeneration today in the body of Christ this is a generation something that affects both singles and married something that is seriously threatening the family Christian family something that is shaking the foundation of the church today because the solid foundation of the church stands true mystically that is Jesus Christ Of Christian interaction Of Christian living Of the display In society today And as I concern He was just a man The first thing we notice When they said he was just a man The next thing that follow Is that This man was just He was just And devout I want you to know something I want you to know something very very important Something very very crucial Something very very very very very essential When the Bible says This man was a just man I want to call Your attention To an issue You will see that issue In Jeremiah chapter 5 Jeremiah chapter 5 Verse 1 1 And 2 Verse 1 and 2 If you read that scripture The Bible says Run tall And through the streets of Jerusalem Pray now And know And see in our open places If you can find a man And see in our open places If there is anyone Who executes judgment Who seeks The truth Who seeks the truth And I will pardon her He said Though they say As the Lord lives Surely They swear falsely What I want you to know Very very well Is this The Lord lives And the people of Israel Is that When there is Indeed I want you to know What I'm saying I want you to To lay this matter To heart When there is indeed A personal walk With God Sign One thing Evident That all that will be evident In the life of a man Who has A personal walk With God Always see coming out of their life Is this matter of being just This matter of being just When there is indeed A personal walk with God Equity Justice The lifestyle Justice The lifestyle One way to know that a man Has a And indeed A personal walk There is a connection Between that man and God That man is knowing God intimately Is that One thing you will find in the life of such an individual Is that One thing you will find in the life of such an individual Is equity Fieriness Truth I mean this issue of being just Comes a lifestyle Equally vital Is this truth When an individual takes promises Vows Holds Lightly It is an indication Of the lack Of the knowledge Of God That man is Knowing God Intimately Is that One thing you will find in the life of such an individual Is equity Fieriness Truth The lack Of the knowledge Of God Or a close walk With God When a man is not just A man is not sincere When you When you find that As an individual You are not You are not a sincere person You don't mean what you say You don't say what you mean Many times you make promises You just break them Promises You tell people Okay We will do this You just Casually About them You make promises You just break them Promises You tell people Okay We will do this Casually About them Nobody of your world Look at how this is manifested In Christian marriages today People will say They take marriage vows To keep And to hold To honor To care for When they enter into the marriage They become monsters To their vows And they start raising justifications My spouse did this My spouse did that The reason why I am like this To know that Something about that You need to live a just life But I want you to note That it is actually a product Eh? Of A intimate Intimate work with God When you say a man is just Come It is It can't just be just What you say Out of a life Of sin The Bible says He was a just man He was a just man He was devout He was devout But in NIV translation He says I am very devout If you look at it In the NIV translation He used the same word Devout In the KJV translation It is the same thing The same man was just And devout If you look at it In the Amplified translation Eh? The Amplified now tries to Amplify the word devout He says devout Eh? He says Cautiously Careful Observing Divine laws Somebody is Cautious Is not casual Is not That is cautiously From an equal yoke Of A man was just And devout I want you to know that He was just a man He was just a man But the Bible is making us to see Something about this man Something we need to check With our own life Of what was going on in his time The land Confusion Earth Artificial people There is not death yet If there was a man That was just And the man was devout And the Bible says That He was waiting For the consolation Of Israel He was waiting For the consolation Of Israel The Bible now told us This man Eh? Is a focused man There is something That was guiding The ritual bearing There was He was looking Was not something material He was not He was not something about What to eat And what to drink And what to drink The Bible says He was waiting For the consolation Of Israel Eh? One thing I want you to know One thing I want you to know That will be out of You call your king Eh? They are able to see The invisible They are able to hear The inaudible There is a As revealed Because the Bible says Where there is no vision The people perish Where there is no vision The people perish On that translation says See what God is doing They stumble over themselves They stumble over themselves You see People Unequally joke with unbelievers Unequally joke with unbelievers They are people Unseen in God Unseen in God Unseen in God Unseen in God Accidents that Accidents that Cannot go far The Bible says Where there is no vision Where there is no vision Where there is no vision The people perish What is that Revealed Seen to manifest If I say your life is a casual Anything that Let me show you Is what your life is like You know that The rock can cut some skin Your church You seem to read the Bible You don't You see what the Bible says about them You see what the Bible says about them Do not develop roots Do not develop roots There was no roots There was no roots Because of the rock The sun came Eh? It's dead with them And what happened? They withered away They withered away They withered away They withered away They withered away They withered away That parable In Matthew 19 In Matthew chapter 13 You'll find that parable there Parable of the sower You can go and check it up yourself You can go and check it up yourself You can go and check it up yourself He said It is those people It is those people Eat the word of life And then they look as if They are going somewhere He said But when trouble But when trouble When temptation When temptation When challenges come Quickly they abandon God Quickly they abandon God Eh? What I'm trying to make you understand What I'm trying to make you understand Is that Is that There is nothing Nothing in your life There is nothing in your life That heaven has revealed And that you are You are You are consistent in honor You are You are waiting for the manifestations And that vision is guiding your life In the way you live Eh? You are a fear wedder, Christian Okay You are a fear wedder, Christian You are not You are not You are not You are not An all wedder You are a fear wedder Christian By the time By the time there are serious issues, troubles and tribulations, when there are serious temptations, you will discover that you will not be able to survive them. That is why you wonder why you look like some of our serious youths and serious brothers are committing fornication. They could not resist some temptations because there is no root in them. You lose until you find others are seemingly serious. When they get to their offices, they collect bribes here and there. They leave unbelievers. They talk like them. They act like them. They steal like them. There is rottenness in their lives like those people because there is no vision over their lives. When they get to church on Sunday or during the weekday, they look very spiritual. They... But the matter is that they cannot stand adversity. The matter is that those ones that fell on the rock, one of supposedly Christians, being deceitful, because kinds of unethical things... You see, it's my personal... It's my personal... I'm saying all these things what I'm explaining to you. The Bible says, where there is no vision, in life of this quiet, for you to learn here as a young man, are you there as a young woman? Eh? What vision are you? You are praying. I'm not talking about marriage. I'm not talking about job. I'm not talking about sex. I'm not talking about... I'm not talking about something mundane. I'm talking about the things of this life. I'm not talking about things that are... Things that are... To see into God, His purpose, His intent, what God is doing, what God knows for preaching at that level. I want to announce to you that the corruption of your own time will overtake you. The reason why the corruption, of this time, the darkness of this time, could not overtake Simon, was because he was a man that was waiting under God for something. And that thing was directing and controlling his life. There is a vision. The people of God cannot perish. The question you call your king today, I'll tell you why they are happening. I'm trying to make you see the... We are talking about young men and young women that are visionless. Young men and young women that have no... Young men and young women that have no serious agenda with God. Eh? They are just casual people in the church. They are casual. Eh? They are over their life with God. When I say serious agenda, Eh? I meant what I said with all the seriousness which it has said it. That is not opportune to be knowing the mysteries of the kingdom. Eh? I have no serious agenda with God. And I can quickly give you a good example so that you can understand it. If you look at Jesus and the disciples, Jesus was carrying the disciples somewhere on the other side eh? At the multitude. All of these people, they were all followers of Jesus. All of them were marching after him. But you will notice something. For the multitude, eh? What is the basis? Of Jesus' interaction with them. You will see it is more of miracles. Miracles. What to eat. Give them bread. Multiply this. Multiply that. That was the life of the multitude. If you check the life of the disciples, eh? You will notice that virtually all the miracles that Jesus did, eh? Just one or two were done for the disciples. The one that was done at the conversion of Peter. I also remember, I can quickly also remember the one that was done for Peter's mother-in-law who was sick with fever. I can also quickly remember the case of paying tax and they went to the river to catch a fish. Majority of the miracles of Jesus were centered on the multitude. Men who are going nowhere with God. Are you with me at all? But you will notice something about Jesus and the disciples. If you go to that same parable of the sower. The disciples were asking Jesus, their master, why is it that to these people you always speak in parables? You don't explain the mysteries of the kingdom. Do you remember the answer of Jesus? Jesus said, eh? It is not given to them to know the mysteries of the kingdom. Eh? But to you, it is given. He said, blessed are your eyes because they see. Blessed are your eyes because they see. I unfortunately want to go to that scripture. Matthew chapter 13. Because these are, these are, these are, these are crucial things. I want to read Matthew 13 from 13. He said, therefore I speak to them in parables because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand. And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled. This says, hearing you will hear and you shall not understand. Seeing you will see and you will not perceive. For the eyes of these people have grown dull. Their ears are hard for hearing and their eyes, they are closed. Lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ear. Lest they should understand with their heart and tongue. So I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear. Are you seeing that when your eyes cannot see the invisible and your ears cannot hear the inaudible you are not blessed. When there is nothing heaven is revealing to you. When there is nothing heaven is telling you. When there is nothing about your life in the kingdom. That is the truth about it. There is nothing serious about your life and the kingdom of heaven. They are closed. Your ears are closed. You hear nothing. You see nothing into God. And you claim to be very busy running here and there with religious activities. Can I announce to you that you cannot laugh? Can I make you see that you are going nowhere? I am telling you today that you cannot laugh. It is the business of unequal joking. You will soon begin to speak like unbelievers if you have not started. You will begin to compromise like them. It is crude. While your life is not producing any justice in terms of equity. I am showing you why in reality why you are not pure as a young believer. Listen to me. I am showing you why your marriage is not stable. The business between him and God. His eyes must see. His ears must hear. You are going nowhere with God. Blessed are your hearts for they see. And your ears for they hear. We are still coming to Simon. You will see what this man said about his eyes. You will see apart from hearing and waiting. You will see what this man said about his eyes and his ears. We are coming there very soon. For assuredly I said to you that many prophets and righteous men desire to see what you see and to they did not see and to hear what you hear but they did not hear. Therefore hear the parable of the sower. Then he translated the parables to them. So for them it was given to know the mysteries of the kingdom. Huh? For them it was given to know the mysteries of the kingdom. You will see that in verse 13. He said he answered and said unto them. It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. But to them it is not given. Anybody to whom it is not given to know the mysteries of the kingdom. I am telling you I have no business with the kingdom. That is the truth about it. That person has no business with the kingdom. He was waiting. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel. He was waiting. He was waiting. Let's go back to that text. I don't want to worry you as we are trying to bring the matter to a close today. I hope I should be able to finish with Simon today. I should be able to finish with him. But at the same time I am not hurrying anywhere. Wherever the Lord can help us to stop we will stop. Huh? But I want you to be picking these lessons one after the other. As a young man and young woman listening to me Please pick these lessons one after the other. And look into your own life. Look into your own life It is very very crucial He was waiting And the next thing you saw about him He said and the Holy Spirit Was upon him The Holy Spirit was upon him The Holy Spirit Was upon him The Holy Spirit Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless If I go I will send you another comforter The Holy Spirit I'm talking about Intimate fellowship with the Holy Spirit The Holy Spirit was upon him I want you to understand That these people operated When Jesus had not died Jesus had not died as at this time And so There was still not the outpour of the Spirit And this man The Bible says the Holy Spirit was upon him This man The Holy Spirit was upon him And for you today Jesus Jesus Has died There is a resurrection There is the outpour of the Spirit How much of the Spirit is upon you? How much of the Spirit is upon you? How much of the Spirit is upon you? How much of the Spirit How much of the Spirit is upon you? Eh? I'm not talking about just tongue-in-tongue-in Tongue-in-tongue-in Because people think that To be free with the Holy Spirit, you just should be tonguing. Eh? People just speak in tongues, speak in tongues, and yet there is no character. There is no integrity. They do all the speaking in tongues, but there is no power. One thing about the Holy Spirit, he said, you shall receive power. Not you shall receive tonguing. I'm not against speaking in tongues because I speak in tongues. In fact, I speak in diversity of tongues. So please, don't think I'm speaking against speaking in tongues. That's not what I'm addressing. But I'm trying to show you that the Bible says, you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. How much of God's power do you operate? First look at it for your personal life. How much of fellowship do you have with the Holy Spirit? How much is the gift of the Holy Spirit operating in your life? Eh? The gift of the Holy Spirit. Which of the gifts is operating? Which of them is visible in your life? Which of them are you using? Are you understanding me? The gift of the Spirit. Apart from His gift, I'm talking about the fellowship again with the Spirit that brings the fruits of the Spirit. The fruits. Not the fruits, but the fruits. Love, joy, peace, self-control, faithfulness, kindness, goodness. The gift of the Holy Spirit in your life. The gift. The power. The Holy Spirit was upon him. There was intimacy between him and the Spirit. There was a connection. And you will see that for you to know it in the next verse. He says it has been revealed to him. Are you seeing something? It has been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit. What is the Holy Spirit revealing to you? What intimacy do you share with the Holy Spirit? He will tell you of things to come. That is one of the major work the Holy Spirit of the Holy Spirit is to tell us of things to come. He is to give us a vision for us to run with. He says write the vision. Make a vision for us. What intimacy do you share with the Holy Spirit? What is he writing upon your world for you to see so that you can run with? What are you running with in God? The Holy Spirit was upon him. Look at something about this man's life. It was written by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord Christ. Are you seeing what he is keeping this man? This man knew he would not die. So when the opponent said how are you? If you don't compromise, they are going to kill you. This man knows that he will not die. He will just smile in his heart. I cannot die until I see the Lord Jesus. When there is a case of this is going on, that is going on, they are killing here, not doing that yet. This man knew in his own time that no matter what is going on, even though the Jews were under the Romans and they were surprised, they were oppressed by the Roman government. This man knew that no matter how anything will happen in his own day, he cannot die until he sees Jesus. A life of rest. What a life of peace. What I am trying to make you see, that the only certainty is that you are going to die. See, life is full of uncertainties. Are you with me? Are you with me there? Full of uncertainties. The only certainty in the uncertainties of life is that which God reveals. Do I take that again? I said life is full of uncertainties. If you look at our Nigeria today, everybody is wondering. We don't know who next will be kidnapped. We don't know who next will die. We don't know what next will kill. We don't know who next will die in accident. There is fear here. There is fear there. Unknown gunmen this way. Kidnappers that way. Bandits the other way. Insecurity everywhere. Much fear and trepidation. It's not doing well. Everything is going down. Everything seems to be going towards towards towards a zero point. There is so much uncertainty. There are so much uncertainties everywhere. What I'm trying to make you understand is this. The only certainty in the uncertainties of life is that which God reveals. So the more God can reveal, the more you start becoming certain about your life. The more you start becoming certain about your future, the more you start becoming somebody who don't fear what they fear. Who don't do what they do. Who don't see what they see. See where they are. Who don't go their way. Revelation is the key. Revelation is the key. And I pray, madam, may the Lord open your eyes in the name of Jesus. May the Lord open your eyes. May the Lord open your ears. May he cause you to see. May your work with God become deeper. May your fellowship with him go sweeter. In the name of Jesus Christ. Young man, arise wherever you are. Deep with God. Move beyond artificiality. He says, it has been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he will not see death. I just tell this man to be confident in the face of death. He will be so confident. A thousand may fall to my side. Ten times the other way, it will not come near me because there is something. May you be strong inside. May you be strong inside. May your inner man be strong. When you grow strength inside. Eh? Be strong, strong in the spirit. Find this same thing in the life of Jesus. The Bible mentions the same thing about Jesus and his development. The Bible mentions it about Jesus. When he was talking about his growth, you will find that the Bible says, the Bible says in that same Luke chapter 2 verse 40, it says, and the child grew and became strong in spirit. In your spirit, be weak inside or be healthy spiritually. You are sick because as he was growing, again, he grew in stature. He grew for intellectual our young people, our young adults to become the intellectual giants for spiritual. Intellectual giants may you grow in the spirit. May you grow in the spirit. He said this man was strong. The spirit have revealed to him that he will be strong. He will not see that. So he came by the spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to the custom of the Lord. When they brought in the child Jesus, this man came into the temple by the spirit. Hallelujah! He was not giving invitation card. He was not the minister. He was not the person to take charge for that day. And so he was not invited to the meeting. But he was supposed to be the minister for that day. And the Holy Ghost knows that. And the Holy Ghost brought in to where he's supposed to minister. I'm telling you what the Holy Ghost can do in your life. Everywhere you're supposed to be in charge. If your fellowship with the Holy Spirit is strong, the Holy Spirit know how to put you at the right location where you will take charge for God. The Holy Ghost brought as many as are led by the spirit. They are the sons of God. Look at the level of demonstration of this man at the time when the Holy Spirit have not been put upon the people of God. Look at what this man was enjoying. And yet, he has not even enjoyed what is wrong with our generation. The Holy Spirit, when you're intimacy with the Holy Spirit is strong, he knows how to put you at the right place. He knows how to lead you into, no, don't do this one today. No, no, go this way. Don't travel this way. Don't travel to this place. Why not not do this today? Why not do that? He used it as a way of putting us where he wanted us to be. To be in charge for God. The Holy Spirit was the one that brought him to the place of his ministry for that day. And so he was there. So when the parents brought in the child to do for him according to the custom of the Lord. He took him. Eh? He took him up into his hand and blessed him and said, Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace according to your word. Eh? And one thing I want to tell you is this. No matter how long God has given you a word, that word will come to pass. Just wait for God. He has, he was given this word that he will not die. That he will see Jesus before he sees death. And that man was there. He was waiting in that situation. And eventually it came to pass. If God gives you a word, I am telling you, stand by that word, wait on that word, it will come to pass. Depart in peace. You have fulfilled your word. Eh? God performs promises. And that is why when you see men who don't perform their promises. When you see men who don't keep to their vows. When you see men who don't mean the things they say. They are godless men. Regardless of the titles they carry. It is godlessness. Eh? To be light-hearted. To say things and you don't mean it. People cannot take you for your word. You cannot stand by your vows. You cannot stand by your promises. You cannot stay with them. You make promises you break them. You tell people this is the condition I am signing the document with you. You don't even need to sign a document with somebody. Your word should be a document signed. A full document. That is what your word should be. Jesus said, let your yea be your yea and your nay be your nay. When you see men who are careless with their words. Who speak things they don't mean. Who say things they don't do. I want to look at such men. I want to announce to you they are godless men. He promised and he brought it. He made it to come to pass. He made that promise to come to pass. He said, now let us depart in peace according to thy words. For my eyes have seen the salvation of Israel. Which you have prepared before the face of the people. A light to bring revelation to the Gentiles. Eh? And to the glory of your people. And look at what happened. He said, and Mary marveled at those things which were spoken of him. Then Simon blessed them and said to Mary and the mother. Behold this child is destined for the fallen and rising of men in Israel. And for Simon we shall be spoken again. Yet a sword will pierce through your own soul that the thought of many hearts might be revealed. What I am trying to say is this. As we close this afternoon. I want to conclude with this. People gathered to do the sanctification for Mary. Eh? The Levites, the high priests, the priests they were there. Ah? Do you notice that in this very episode the actual minister for that day was Simon. Every other person that were there as ministers they were not actually ministers. They were officers. They were just officiating. They were doing the official assignment. They were performing the relics and the traditions. The real thing that was going on what God was doing that day eh? They were blind to it. That is the situation of many of our ministers today. They are just officiating. They are not ministering. And I say young man what do you want to grow up into? To be officiating or to be a minister? You call them ministers. You call them the priests, the high priests, the Levites. People were supposed to know what was going on. They knew nothing. They were blind. Eh? They did not see what God was doing. They did not even know that redemption had come. They just did the sacrifices and did every other thing. And then oh okay okay. And then okay Jesus you are now here. You are dedicated to God. And then you can go. They just did the normal thing they normally do. They did not understand that something significant was going on. Everyone was visiting hell. God in the form of man there is a manifestation for the redemption of Israel. There is a manifestation for the redemption of creation. God the creator and God visited the hell. There is a visitation of and they were blind to all of these. What is your situation as a minister? What is your situation? That they were so blind. They were so dead to the things of God. That God was not interested in using any of them. God went to bring his man for the minister for that day. But we discovered that Zechariah was not like this one. Zechariah was part of what God was doing. He was a priest. So don't think that all priests are useless. There are still exceptions here and there. But what I am trying to say is what the Bible says. Who can find a faithful man? A faithful man who can find? Men like Simon. Silent generals. Men who are strong in the spirit. The generality is emptiness. The generality is just shadows. The generality they are clouds without rain. They are wells without water. When you touch their lives, you touch deadness. When you touch their lives, you touch officiating. You cannot touch ministrations. You cannot through them touch God. You cannot through them feel God. You cannot through them know what God was saying. All those people that day, they could not help Mary and Joseph to touch what God was doing. But there was a man through whom Mary and Joseph touched God that day. That was Simon. May you be different from the dead ministers of our days in the name of Jesus. There is so much unequal yoking in the land. But we are trying to see what makes men to be different. And I pray you will be different. You will be different. Let us go ahead to pray this morning.

But for September, we couldn't continue with that. We couldn't continue with that in September. We looked at preparing for the future. So now, we want to pick the matter of Seeds Like Joseph, which we started in the month of August. We have done Seeds Like Joseph 1. We want to do Seeds Like Joseph 2 today. And if we can conclude everything about Joseph, we may not look at that again in the month of October. We want to take time out to pray. Let's pray. Let's pray this morning.

Thank You, Eternal Father. Blessed be Your holy name, our God, in the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus. Fit like Joseph. Fit like Joseph. As we consider this topic this morning, we are asking that You will speak to us. You will speak to us. Speak to us in a way that will come very clearly to us. Now, fit like Joseph. Fit like Joseph. Fit like Joseph. Fit like Joseph. we have been able to look at the matter such that what joseph stands for is uncommon life what joseph represents um that was in the month of august um so many things have been said about joseph we saw how uncompromising joseph was in his lifetime we saw how he was able to live a life that ordinarily one would be thinking that maybe joseph was acting out a script like in a drama where you know that everything is being recorded and so you are you are trying to live correctly you are trying to to live in a way that it would um uh meet the uh the intended line of drama in the case of joseph it was not he was not acting a script he was just living his life not even aware that everything will be recorded like this for us to read so we have seen the life of joseph and then we got to the point in the month of august where where we concluded we're trying to look at what is it that made joseph to be this uncompromising what is this about his life that made joseph to be this uncompromising and we we have looked we saw that there are three important things to look at in the life of joseph um those of those three important things we have been able to look at two of them we have been able to look at one of them in the month of august we mentioned three things we said the first one is um one joseph has shared intimacy with god that was manifested in loving righteousness and hating wickedness number two a clear understanding of the principle of faithfulness and then number three earnestness to be a positive influence so in the month of august we have been able to look at the life of joseph and we are able to look at one of these three qualities that is in the life of joseph that made him to be a very very different person um so we want to continue from the second that's why we left the matter in august which is joseph had a clear understanding of the principle of faithfulness and we want to look at this principle of faithfulness and we want to look at what is it that joseph clearly understood that made him to be to be that of compromises and i pray that as we look at this principle from scripture comparing scriptures with scripture it will become a matter that will be clear to us too it will become a matter that we too want to put in our own lives i want to live on i also want to live back in the month of august i took us to the first scripture about this matter the first scripture about it which is in luke chapter 16 and that is where we'll be starting off today look chapter 15 a clear understanding of the principle of a faithfulness a clear understanding of the principles of faithfulness luke chapter um 16. let's see that scripture together luke chapter 16 luke 16 i will take my reading from around verse 10 he who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches if you have not been faithful in what is another man who will give you what is your own we are trying to look at exactly what joseph understood that made him to live the life that he lived a clear understanding of the principle of faithfulness how do we know that joseph has this clear understanding you will see that in what joseph said in that genesis when you look at that genesis joseph made a statement a statement that made us made us to see that this understanding of this principle was very clear in the acts of joseph such that it is not something that is not clear in his heart look at look at what happened in that genesis 39 the bible says uh the bible says that um let's look at it from verse 6 talking about portifa no let's take it from seven and it came to pass after this thing that joseph that is master's wife casts longing eyes on joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said to his master's wife Look, my master does not know what is with me in the house And he has committed all things he has to my hands I want to make you see that Joseph understands He has a clear understanding of the principle of faithfulness The principle that makes us To live a life of complete sincerity and transparency With whoever we are in relationship with Whether they are there or they are not there Look at what he said, the master was not here He said He said He said That he has refused But he refused and said to his master's wife Look, my master does not know what is with me in the house And he has committed all things he has to my hands There is no one greater in this house than I Nor has he kept back Anything from me But you Because you are his wife How then can I do this great wickedness And sin against God Are you seeing something? So, Joseph was standing for the cause of his master Though the master was not there Something was wrong with him Something was wrong with him Something was wrong with him Something was wrong with him Something was wrong with him Something was opening up for him in his favor A quick sexual pleasure To cause the master's wife's favor There was an opening for him But that opening Would be against a trust That had been committed to him And so, the Bible says It is required The Bible says It is required To be committed to him To be committed to him To be committed to him To be committed to him To be committed to him To be committed to him that a man be faithful so joseph knew that there is a requirement a requirement to be faithful i'm talking about the qualities what made joseph who he was to make you see that joseph had joseph has a clear understanding of the principle of faithfulness it is something that is clear to him and i want to tell you something when you see a young man ah who is not sincere and transparent as a christian the problem that person is having is the person does not understand the principle of faithfulness faithfulness is a principle that if you truly understand it you cannot compromise it when you see men who live anyhow oh they don't understand the implication of what it means to be faithful they think it's just something anyhow yeah no it is not that's what i want to show you today i want to show you what this principle um i suppress the implication of not being faithful the adversity that you can break into your life by not being faithful in fact many people in different ways have caused or have cut their life shots because of this what many people are suffering today in their lives and it looks like every door is closed against them it's because they didn't know that at a point in their life they did not live by the principle of faithfulness and that's what i want to make it to say you are not aware that when did you begin to see that in small small small small things that you are saying it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh it should be we understand now hey we understand my husband we understand my wife we understand the fellowship we understand that we understand and little little you are doing a lot of little things and it's just a small thing now how many i have to roll how many did i take out of i took only one out of 200 what is one in 200 i got one there to enjoy myself they look little little little little little a small lie to your mother a small lie to your father hey not only that i wanted to lie i don't just want them to understand you know and it looks like you are escaping bro see you are not escaping you are digging your grave you are gradually destroying yourself it's like the smoker huh who would take the sickness tobacco and it looks like it's enjoy in every second but science says for every in and out of tobacco in seconds has been deducted from the land lifespan so every one one second before you know it accumulates for several years it is the same thing let me tell you every time you act against faithfulness every time you are not sincere and true let me and let me try to define this being sincere and being true i want to take you to something in the book of proverbs and i will be reading the amplified version something in the book of proverbs i will read the amplified version please let's go to proverbs proverbs chapter 3 i want to show something about undertaking this matter of faithfulness the practical thing that we are calling faithfulness and practically what we mean now when you read the kingdom version in proverbs chapter 3 verse 3 and 4 he says let's he says let's not mercy and let's not mercy and let's not mercy and let's not mercy and truth let don't allow mercy truth let don't allow mercy truth let don't allow mercy and truth forsake you and truth forsake you and truth forsake you bind them around your neck bind them around your neck bind them around your neck write them on the tablet of your heart write them on the tablet of your heart write them on the tablet of your heart and so find favor and so find favor and so find favor and i esteem in the sight of god and man that is king james look at the way king james put it when you look at how it expresses here one thing that is clear if there is something you must do he says don't allow mercy and truth to forsake you bind them around your neck write them on the tablet of your heart that is what i want to read to you in the amplified version let's not mercy mercy and kindness that is the first one you know not let mercy and truth want to look at first mercy mercy what does he mean when we're talking about mercy and kindness what does that mean amplified now we're talking about mercy and kindness look at isis amplified that is let's not shutting out of all hatred and selfishness don't allow the shutting out of all hatred and selfishness huh whichever of them i'm talking about mercy mercy mercy is ability to shut out hatred from your heart and to shut out selfishness from your heart i'm talking about what it means to be faithful eh shutting out of hatred shutting out of selfishness eh don't let it forsake you then the other one truth oh amplification of truth look at isis oike' it then the other one truth omega ca quote of isis oike theระ type roots it shutting out deliberates hypocrisy and falsehood we are talking about being truthful to be truthful is that you are shutting out on one hand you shut out all hatred and selfishness that is what it is it means that mercy or kindness you do not allow the freedom everything else will be the same mercy i'm not constantly showing them justice all ответ that you pinching me at it will командois you don't allow it to forsake you you are writing it on the tablet of your heart the other one that is now truth is that you are shutting out all deliberate hypocrisy and falsehood now we are talking about faithfulness faithfulness is the ability of anybody an individual in relating to his neighbor and when i say your neighbor i mean anybody that you are relating with your parents your wife your husband your employee your employer your students your teacher your just your patients your clients your workers whichever way all your network of relationship to be faithful to people is that you deliberately shut out hatred and selfishness from your heart you can see how joseph was not selfish the door was something opening for him pleasure with the master's wife after all the master don't know what goes in or goes out he will just be enjoying himself and i see how the master's wife too will now have special love for him and he will be speaking well about him with uh patifa you know that boy is a very very good boy because now they have emotional connection joseph was looking at all those doors but no selfishness will not take over him because he's realizing that ah ah but this is somebody else's wife this is not my own no i must not be selfish i must not be selfish this is not correct this is not correct i'm telling you if you don't learn to live like this you are digging your grave it may look as if you are enjoying but i will soon show you you are when you are relating with people when you are dealing with people in wherever anywhere in whatever my life is you are dealing with people in wherever anywhere in whatever my life is if you are somebody with always you know thinking look at every way you can take advantage of our people absolutely can just be the one that are opening for you that is just you, you, you, your relationship i'm telling you you will not last in that thing on the long run it will not pay you off I'm going to show you what to make you see these things as we go on on the long run you will realize that you have only ended up in digging your destruction you are the one who is the architect and the chief pilot of your destruction your war and your doom your weeping and your sorrow is what you are carving out if you don't know you may think ah i've taken advantage of them it is because you are blind i want to show you what joseph understood what made him uncommon uncompromising you see when men understand this thing they don't live anyhow because faithfulness is a matter that the lord raised he looks after his team and he's making us succeed that's number one the lord wants us to understand that faithfulness is not only it's not only in big things it's not when you want to say this is a serious matter i must be faithful no as far as the lord is concerned he who is not faithful in little is not faithful in much so faithfulness cuts across the seven level of life you have today and the reason why you may not come to mosh in your life is how you have handled literally oh did you get that did you get that the reason why you may not you may never come to mosh in your life is that you were not faithful in literally because if you are not faithful in little the lord will not organize much for your life because the lord knows that you can never be faithful you will dig a bigger grave for yourself and because the lord does not want you to be destroyed you know we keep dealing with your life on that issue until you become faithful you know in this we talk as a father it's like it's like it's like a child that the father have so much and the boy is just 11 years and say daddy daddy daddy ah i want to drive this car too because the father loves the child he knows the child cannot handle the motion car he cannot be able to undo that thing it is something is something that can destroy him he needs to grow up a little and become more mature to be able to handle such a thing the father will not give him not because the father did not did not want to let him have it but because i know that giving him at that very very young age will destroy him that's what i'm trying to say the reason why god may never organize much for your life and leave you at the level of little is that baba can still see clearly in your life that you are not faithful over literally and so to keep you from greater destruction that's beginning to deal with you until you can pass and the elementary exams baba says no don't take him to advanced courses if he cannot handle elementary exam it will not be it will not be good give him advanced statistics i don't know whether you understand what i'm trying to say he says if he is faithful over little will be the one that will be faithful over much now that that's what i'm trying to make you see so when you see a man who is not faithful in little why he will be thinking that he's taking advantage of people he's cutting himself short and from the flow that could have come to his life he's cutting himself short of several doors that baba could have opened for him he's cutting him or herself short of blessings that could have flowed so why you may be thinking sometimes that yes took advantage of him he didn't know i was able to get it i was so smart uh you were not smart you are only stupid and foolish or faithfulness is not smart un-faithfulness is foolishness and stupidity please hear me well un-faithfulness is not smartness un-faithfulness is foolishness and stupidity i pray you will not be foolish and i pray that you will not be stupid look un-faithfulness is not smartness that's what this generation of this life this you know the world call un-faithfulness i hammered the person i got him ah you didn't get anything you didn't you you never got him rather you shot yourself in the leg every un-faithfulness you are shooting yourself in the leg i pray you will not remain stupid i pray you will not remain foolish let the lord grant you deliverance from every case of unfaithfulness in your life in the name of jesus christ so what is it i'm going to properly operationalize what it means to be faithful what it means to be faithful is the ability of an individual to shut out selfishness from the heart and number two to shut out deliberate hypocrisy and falsehood you will never ever to the slightest imagination practice hypocrisy or falsehood you will never do it it can never be something you do in life i'm showing you what joseph understood what joseph understood now unfaithfulness and faithfulness we are seeing that the lord said he who is not faithful in little cannot be faithful in much and look at verse 11 implication we're trying to look at we have operationalized what it means to be faithful we want to be looking at the implications we have looked at the first one if you are not faithful over little you cannot you are not faithful so much so little decide much uh please don't shut the door of god against your life now verse 11 i will say that little decide much in verse 10 in verse 11 the master now said look at what our lord said therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammoth who will commit to your trust the true riches so it is like they will first test you with little little things the unrighteous mammoths what is not the real one i remember you know you know what i'm remembering i i think they still do that now and what we still do now with when a child is in kg before they get to nozri 2 the kg classes you know you will notice that they will give them pencil and eraser they will not give them bible first they will not give them the true riches they will allow them to be using pencil and eraser so that when they mistake when there is a mistake when any mistake is made what happens they can easily erase and clean they will not start with bible with them they will first start with your righteous moment that is not what they believe to write in libel what do you use to write in life is viral but over starts with them with pencils ah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah it's as they begin to master the art and grow our master the art and grow and become more mature by then they cross to higher classes by now they should be able to handle byro they now put byro into their hands that is what I am trying to that is the picture that came to my head before they give you what you will need in life they will first give you what is not the what is not the true riches they will first try to see how you will be faithful hey oh oh I pray for everybody listening to me this morning may the Lord grant us a strong spirit of faithfulness faithfulness is a look I am telling you it is a fundamental thing in life eh may you not have destroyed your future before you get into that future you know last week it was preparing for the future eh last month sorry the month of September it was preparing for the future may you not have destroyed that future before you get there some young people have destroyed their future before they enter that future they now begin to think eh it must be this eh maybe my brother-in-law cousin is the one behind my suffering maybe my wife since I married it is like I am not making progress maybe it is my wife maybe it is my husband eh maybe it is this ah you begin to run from pillar to post sometimes let us be careful let us be careful let us be careful I am not saying that we don't have adversaries eh there are battles the enemy sometimes want to take advantage of us but we must fight and live in a liberty where he can set us free but I am talking about the fact that we are not free but I am talking about where we sow seed eh of corruption eh because the Bible says that do not be deceived God cannot be mocked eh if we sow to the flesh will we of the flesh reap corruption will we of the flesh reap corruption and if we sow to the spirit will we of the spirit reap eternal life So, I'm talking about we must be careful not to sow to the flesh. Because if we sow to the flesh, it says of the flesh we will reap corruption. And so that what you may be seeing in the future may not be reaping what you have sown at a particular time. What you did. And so let us be careful how we live. Young man, young woman listening to me this morning, wherever you are, let us be careful how we live. Let us be very careful. Before the original is given, before they give you viral, where you are going, they will first give you pencil. Then you want to see how you are doing, how you are able to fare well with pencil. Before they now bring viral your way. Huh? Before your life, you don't fare well with pencil, you may never get viral, you may never get viral. That's what you are looking at in this place. So let's look at, let's continue with our reading. And verse 11. It says, Therefore, if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammoth, who will commit to your trust the true riches? That is one. The second one in verse 12. Huh? It says, And if you had not been faithful in what is another man's, who will give you what is your own? Are you seeing that? Number one is that before they give you the reality, they will give you what may look like a miniature, a picture of what is to come. Hmm? What will look like the shadow before they now give you the substance. Then another very serious thing is that, before they will give you your own, they will first give you what belongs to other people. They will want to see how you will handle it. If you handle it faithfully, then you will get your own. If you don't handle it faithfully, you will never get your own. I'm showing you the matter that surrounds the principle of faithfulness. The implication and the consequences of not being faithful. What Joseph understood that made him to do what he did in the house of Potiphar. I said Joseph had a clear understanding of the principle of faithfulness. It was something he was very clear about. And so, you notice that, because Joseph had a deep realization that although this woman belongs to my master, she was placed around me. You know, Joseph could always be in the house with that woman. She was placed around me. For God to see how I will handle what belongs to other people. And many times bro, many sisters have been placed around your life like that. Sisters, many brothers have been placed around your life like that. Were you busy fornicating? Were you busy pressing breasts here and there? Were you busy some form of immorality? You think it was a silent, a quiet enjoyment. You don't understand that Baba was placing what belongs to other people around your life. To know whether it will need to make you sleep so that they can carve out Eve for you. They can carve out your own Eve. But what Baba saw in your life was that you were not faithful to what belonged to other men. So when you got to your own junction of marriage, you didn't get favor. To marry the right, to marry the person with your own. You married but you didn't marry your own. It's like wearing an oversized shoe because you were not favored. Because I must tell you, the battle is not to the strong, the rage is not to the sweet. It is the mercy of God that help us. If not for God, we cannot build our life. Look at what the Bible says. Except the Lord build the house. The laborers, what are they doing? They are laboring in vain. Except God is working over the city. The watchmen, what could they do? They lie awake in vain. What I am saying is that it is not how strong, it is not how well, you see. It is not how swift, how strong we are that make us to always get things right. It is because God himself also watches over us. It is because God himself also watches over us. The Bible says he is the one who is able to keep us from falling. You see, it is he who works in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure. So if God don't help us, if God don't work in us, we are doomed. If God don't help our infirmities, we are bound to err. So when it says, you know, he that find a wife finds a good thing. And obtain what? Favor from God. So finding a good thing in a wife. Is on account of the favor of God. If God don't favor you, you cannot find a good thing in a wife. You may find adversity. The same thing in a husband. You may find adversity. You may find all kinds of things. Because you are not faithful. They do say the same thing happens with money. With riches, with opportunity. And you can say that in the life of Joseph. Before it came to that of the woman. Which was the second level. Marital testing. Before they would not give him his own. There was also financial, career, occupational testing. You notice that he was first managing all the man's property. And he was faithful. And God was blessing the man because of Joseph. The man had left everything in the hands of Joseph. And Joseph still remained faithful. That's why Joseph could say that everything my master has is in my hands. It does not count what is here and there. So before God eventually brought Joseph. To be managing riches or fidget. God had first made him to manage what belonged to other men. To see how faithful he would be. That was how he was able to manage. When he entered into his own office. Do you know that it was that prison that brought Joseph to that office? If he didn't go through that prison there would have been no office of prime minister for him. That is why I am still coming to that anyway. But what I just want to make you see now. Is that one thing about faithfulness. That you need to understand. In terms of implications and consequences. Is that you are first giving what belongs to other men. What belongs to other men. At different times. Their money. Their riches. Whatever. The way you undo those wounds. With that whether you will get your own. Whether you will get your own. Whether you enter into your own type of job. Your own type of career. Your own type of wealth. What would be exactly aligning with your own purpose and plan for your own life. What is customized for you. See your life is customized. You are wonderfully and faithfully made. You cannot just take anything and anything. No. There is a job for you. There is wealth and riches. Customized for your own purpose in life. You are not supposed to enter into some kind of wealth or some kind of debt. What I am about to say is that. God has a plan for your life. I mean you are uniquely made. There are no two you. So if your size is 42. And you go and wear size 45. What will happen to your life? I am talking about maritaly, career wise, riches all of that. If you enter into size 45. The thing will be dropping from your leg. You will not be able to do well in life. Do you know that. Even riches that you don't need can make you not to do well in life. You see. Young people I am begging you to listen to me. These are very very crucial things to note. Be noting the points as you have started. The first thing. I will not personalize what faithfulness means. We saw that little brings too much. We saw that you are first given what is not real. Before you get what is real. Then we saw that look. Another thing is that. You don't first get your own. You first get what belongs to other men. Before you now get your own. And then I want to move further. Do you really realize. Huh. That faithfulness. Is actually. Huh. Step in the ladder. Of life. Faithfulness. They are like the step. In the ladder of life. Faithfulness. Sorry. Faithfulness is like. Faithfulness is like the steps. In the ladder. Of life. You will say. How do I mean. Now when you look at the ladder. You know you have the horizontal. You have the vertical. Log. To both sides. The vertical one. Long. Like that means the length. Of the ladder. Then you now have the vertical short short ones. That join the two long ones together. You know those ones from the step. Step one. Step two. Step three. As you climb each of those vertical ones. You are going higher. As you. As you. Go higher and higher. Until you get to the end of the ladder. Is that what I am trying to say. Faithfulness. Is. Like those steps. Those steps. And you know that. When you want to climb the ladder. What do you do? You first look down. Before you look up. You look down. To place your leg. On the first step. You don't look up. You must look down. You are first looking down. Before you now look up. The looking down. In the ladder. Is actually. Matter that we have been discussing. You are not first giving your own. You are giving what belongs to other men. You first have to look down. You first have to submit yourself. You first have to humble yourself. You first have to go down. You first have to die. Before you leave. You first have to deny yourself. You have to shut out. You first have to go down. The way up. Is first to go down. Are you understanding me? You first have to look down. What belongs to other people. What is not the true riches. Little little. Be faithful first in little. Because those step one, step two. Actually they are little little steps. They are not very high. You can replace them with a stool. You can put other things. If that is all the height you want to go. You can even put two or three chairs together. And climb it. It will give you the height of those chairs. It will give you the height of those steps. So they are little little things down. But you know as you step higher. That is when they land and become very very useful. As the lower steps. They are not so useful. Because something else can replace them. It is as the little little things that you are first given. So you first have to look down. I am talking about faithfulness as the steps of life. Nobody start climbing a ladder by looking up. Because you will miss your step down. So you look down. Step one. Step two. Step three. Step four. At some point you will notice. Your focus will now start changing. From looking down. To looking up. From looking down. To looking up. You will now start looking up. Now what I am trying to say is this. If you remove those steps. From the ladder. The two vertical long steps. The two vertical long steps. The two vertical long steps. Log. The roof to both sides. They will fall off. There will be no ladder again. That is number one. Number two. Even if those two vertical ones. If they remain standing. There is nothing to climb to go up. Are you understanding me? There is nothing to climb. So actually. The height. That God intend for your life. It is the step of faithfulness. that helped you to climb the ladder. I'm trying to make you see what Joseph understood. It is that step of faithfulness that you begin to climb. One, two, and then you are going up, up, up, up. That is what you saw in Joseph. It was the ladder of faithfulness that helped him to climb. When he entered Potiphar's house, he was just like any other servant. When the master saw that he was different, he committed more into his hand. When the master saw it again, he left everything in his hand. Including his wife. Joseph managed everything. But it's not to touch the wife. Every property, Joseph became like the lord of the house. He was a servant like any other servant. He was lifted high above all of them. He was exalted. I pray for you. May you be distinguished among your equals. May you be separated among your equals. But I'm showing you the principle. Joseph rose above his equals. Joseph became the commander of his equals. He rose. I'm showing you how God, faithfulness is God's principle of lifting you up. If you rise above faithfulness, eh, let me tell you one thing. Eh, that is the prosperity of fools. Or prosperity of the wicked. You know what the Bible says about that prosperity? Eh? It says, the Bible says, He made them prosper so that He may destroy them. That's another nature of prosperity. I'm talking of prosperity in which God sustains a man. It's by faithfulness. When you rise, not by faithfulness, you know what is happening to you? They are lifting you up eh, on a balloon. And you are going up and you are thinking you are going up. By the time you get to some height, they will now puncture the balloon. Boom! And then you know what that means. But when a man is rising by the principle of faithfulness, that is God's method of lifting up his own. Every step is sustained. It is not being put, it is not being placed on a balloon. So you need to understand this. You need to get this very, very clear and understand it. That's faithfulness. If you look at it, Joseph began to go up, up, up, up. Then there was the problem of the wife. He remained faithful. He entered into prison. But the prison is part of the place because it must become Pharaoh's second in command. How will he get there? Huh? So Joseph actually did not regress in life. The imprisonment was a progress in life. And what was to bring him there was suffering for being faithful. Oh, do you understand me? What I'm trying to make you understand, when you are faithful, there are some suffering. But those sufferings have been arranged to be part of what will bring you to the path that will bring you to your greatness. Huh? But sometimes because you don't want to suffer for being faithful, that's why you deviate. And as you deviate, you also lose the next step to the next step to the next step that will bring you to where you are supposed to get to. May you not miss your step in life in the name of Jesus. So, you notice that there is no way to get to Pharaoh. He needs to get to Pharaoh. He needs to interpret somebody's dream. That person will now at some point raise up his matter. So, how will he meet that person? The person was in Pharaoh's prison. He must go to Pharaoh's prison. The way God has designed it is by being blackmailed for being faithful. So, when you suffer for being faithful, count it all joy. God is taking you. He is taking you somewhere. God has not abandoned you. God has not left you. Faithfulness can bring us into suffering. It can bring us into imprisonment. Eh? Do you remember that of Job too? Faithfulness brought him into serious loss. Do you see what left Job in a day? Because he was faithful. So, the faithfulness of God in our life can bring us into some kind of suffering. But those sufferings I feel they are part of the way to greatness. Look at faithfulness in the life of our Lord Jesus. He suffered, suffered, suffered, suffered, suffered. But the Bible says for this reason. God highly exalted him. And he gave him a name that is above every other name. That at the name of Jesus every noose he bowed. How did he get there? The sufferings that came in faithfulness. I see the generation today that don't want to suffer for faithfulness. So, they deviate from faithfulness. See a generation. If I don't manipulate and look for a way to pass this exam and get a first class. Eh? I may not do well in life. So, they quickly do some 419. They quickly do some sitting exams and practices to get a first class. Mind you, what God may need for their lives is the faithfulness to get a 2-2. And with that 2-2, God wants to do something to bring them somewhere. He wants to use practical things to illustrate these things for you. Whatever you get by unfaithfulness. Eh? I'm telling you. We actually close a door. The correct door that you are supposed to take to where you are going. There is a door for you to take. There is a path for you to follow. And faithfulness is that step. It is step by step. Later you need to climb. This is what Joseph understood. And he understood this clearly. That was why we call him uncompromising Joseph. Because he understood the principle of faithfulness. As we close this morning. Hmm? I want to call your attention to ehm ehm something that I'll just mention it. Just to make you see it somewhere again. That faithfulness is a very very strong thing. You remember Mordecai? You remember Mordecai? Mordecai was like a security man. A security man for the king. You go to know that some people were planning some things against the king. And he acted faithfully. He reported them. When he reported them, it looked like no reward. Nothing for that faithfulness. Eh? Much much much much much more later in life. When Ammon had concluded every plan. Eh? To finish Mordecai. The plan had been concluded. It was to just come and finish off the plan with the king. The Bible says that night the king could not sleep. Somebody had been faithful and he must be rewarded. May your record be straight. In the name of Jesus. Wherever you are listening to me this morning I pray may your record be straight. May your record be straight. May your record be straight. May your record be straight. That by the time we open the books it will be he had been faithful he needs to be rewarded. May that be your case. May that be your story. May your story not be otherwise in the name of Jesus. A man has been faithful so he cannot die like that. He cannot die like that. That night the king could not sleep. And God began to control the king's heart. Eh? Open book and be reading for me daddy. Maybe that will make me to sleep. Open the book and be reading. Oh! This case, this case that they reported then. What have we done for the man? He says nothing has been done. Oh! I did not reward that man. Why at that moment? I am talking about faithfulness. Eh? As critical junctions in your life your record will speak. May they speak good for you and not evil. Critical junctions in life. Critical junctions. Record of faithfulness spoke for Mordecai. So that therefore as we pray this morning look at Proverbs 11 Proverbs 11 as we pray together Proverbs 11 Proverbs chapter 11 Proverbs 11 Proverbs 11 Proverbs 11 Look at what the Bible says from verse 1 The sonnest case are abominations to the Lord. Be careful don't take your skills. Eh? Don't practice the sonnest case but a just wit is a delight. Be just. Be true. Be true to man. Be true to God in whatever you are doing. God gives abominations to God. Don't become abominable to God. Let's make this your life. Live in a way that God can favor you. You need the favor of God at every junction. The battle is never to the strong. The race is never to the swift. Please let your skills be just. When pride comes then comes shame. And when you lift yourself against the principle of God you only come to shame. It will only bring you to shame. Submit yourself under the mighty hand of God. Choose to be true even when you have to suffer for it. Submit yourself. Avoid arrogance. Don't try to escape. Agree with God. Submit to God. Don't lift yourself against His principles. Don't imagine things that are above the knowledge of God. Submit yourself to the truth of God. Submit yourself to the truth of God. It says that with the humble is wisdom. Please please stay with the Lord. That is wisdom. Verse 3 The integrity of the upright will guide them. Are you seeing it? The integrity of the upright will guide them. But the perversity of the unfaithful will destroy them. Are you seeing it? Are you seeing this thing? I believe you are following this thing. It says if you look at that in NIV The integrity of the upright will guide them. But the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity. Young man, young woman duplicity will only destroy you. It will only destroy you. Financially, maritally, career wise duplicity will only destroy you. Run away from duplicity. Become an uncompromising Joseph. Have a fit like Joseph. A fit, a fit. That's your step. Be like that of Joseph. Fit like Joseph. Fit like Joseph. Make up your mind. Make up your mind. You will not be able to take the third principle that will be in the month of November. The third principle about the life of Joseph. How? Earnestness to be a positive influence anywhere you are which will be next month. We are looking at, we will conclude that of faithfulness today. It says the righteousness of the blameless will direct their way but the wicked will fall by their own wickedness. Joseph would have fallen if he did wickedly. He would say, how will I do this wicked thing? How will I do this? I can't do wickedness. You see what wickedness will do? The righteousness of the blameless will direct their way but the wicked will fall by their own wickedness. Thus says the Lord to Joseph. Joseph Joseph Joseph Don't do this thing because if you do it you will not enter into prison and from there become There was no prophecy. There was no prophet. There was no Holy Ghost. There was no one thing speaking here and there or signs in the world. Eh? Your word have I hidden in my heart that I might not sin against you Your word is sharper than two edged sword You are a consuming fire That was the way of Joseph Lord your word have I hidden in my heart. Your word says I should be faithful and that's what was hidden in his heart He refused to allow truth to forsake him He heard so write it upon the tablet of your heart It is not every time that we don't sense the Lord No One way the Lord guides us from destruction is instruction that we should hide this word in our heart Hide this word in your heart Tremble at the word of God Let the word of God dwell in you richly Eh? And verse 6 The righteousness of the upright will deliver them But the unfaithful are caught by their own lusts The unfaithful Eh? They are caught by their own lusts Do you not be destroyed by your unreasonable desires He says The unfaithful They are caught by their own lusts I don't know whether you have any question this morning I believe you are listening You can send in question by 11.30 I don't know Technically do we have any question on the screen Do you have any question already sent to us that we can respond to Ok We don't have any question Plus if you are there you have been listening Maybe you forgot that you also have sent in your question We are giving you just 2 minutes If there is a question you want to send to us Please send it now If there is a question please do so In the next 2 minutes before we close We want to pray Technically there is no question as of now So we want to pray now Any question Any question please there are If you are listening to us please send in your question Send in your question if there are questions Send in your question if there are Send in your questions If there are So let us go ahead then to pray No question is coming Father we thank you for this morning We just commit ourselves into your hand Lord we pray That you will grant unto us A faithful spirit In all we think In all we say In all we do In the name of Jesus Lord grant us a faithful spirit Lord please help us Help us in secret In hope May we not go the way of destruction There is a way that seems right unto a man But the end thereof is destruction Lord help us to go the way of the Lord In all we do Lord help us to go your way Lord incline our heart to your fear Direct our heart to your love Lord God our high is on you Let nothing prevail against your purposes In our lives Thank you eternal Father In Jesus name We pray Amen Let's share the grace together The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ The love of God And the fellowship of the Holy Spirit Be with us now And forevermore Amen This message is coming to you From Family Tenth Ministry Equestrian ministry Involving enriching the lives of singles And marriage Through preaching and teaching of God's word Discipleship Family life enrichment Social And community development As well as Mission Heap Our regular activities Are Discipleship class Every Monday 5pm Adolescent and singles club Every first Saturday Of every month At 10am Marriage forum Second Saturday Of every month at 10am Family life seminars Regular school outreaches And everyday counselling For further counselling You can reach us at our location Life camp by the first bridge Illiri community Opposite the Rejoy filling station Along Gijare road Akure Undo State, Nigeria You can also reach us through our Social media handles Familytenth at yahoo.co.uk Familytenth ministry Whole1hygiene.com www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org www.familytenthministry.org\"}\n",

In Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 11. Hebrews chapter 11. In Hebrews chapter 11, the Bible raised a very, very important issue I want to draw, you know, call your attention to. The Bible was talking about our understanding that there's going to be a, you know, a shaking. And when that shaking takes place, the Bible says everything that is shakable will definitely shake away. So that only the things that cannot be shaking, that will be the only thing that will remain. The only thing that will remain will be things that cannot be shaking. Hebrews chapter 12. Sorry, Hebrews chapter 12. Let's go to Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews 12. Let's see Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews chapter 12, around verse 27 and thereabouts. Hebrews 12, around verse 27. The Bible was speaking about the fundamental, you know, the foundation. Of things. When the Bible got still, I want you to see something from around the verse 26. Let me take it from there. He says whose voice then shook the earth. But now, He has promised, saying, yet once more, I shake not only the eggs but also heaven. Now, this yet once more indicates the remover of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain. He said yet. He said now, this yet once more indicates the remover of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, as of things that are made. You see, when he says there's going to be a shaking, the Bible is saying that there's going to be a shaking of those things that are being shaken. As of things that are made, of those things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain. And what am I calling your attention to this matter today? To the matter of shaking. Is that, if you have carefully looked at events in recent times, you will notice that a lot of unusual things are happening around us. A lot of things are taking place. A lot of things are coming up. They are not, please understand me, they are not necessarily things that are new. But they are things that are unexpected. That's what I'm saying. There's nothing new under the sun. There is nothing new under the sun. The Bible says, What will happen now, what is happening now, has happened before. Then what has happened before will happen again. The only difference is that the people that is happening to now, because they do not know the history of those that it happened to before, they will now think it's something that is new. So the Bible says it is because the new, the succeeding generation, that's Exodus chapter 1, did not know the history of several, you know, generations that preceded them. And so they are thinking that what is happening to them is new. But it is nothing new. It is something that has been before. So I'm only talking of the happening of things that are new. I'm talking of, the happening of things that are not, that are not expected. The happening of things that are not expected. You know, the happening, and so, the way they are happening today, they are looking strange. The way they are coming today, they are appearing something very, very strange. They are looking like something that, ah, what kind of, what, hey, what? And that is what I'm trying to say. Eh? Eh? That is why the Bible says that there was once a shaking. So it's not as if shaking is a new thing. Eh? There was once a shaking. But again, there's going to be another shaking. That's what I'm trying to say. Eh? So it's not as if shaking a thing. Shaking thing. Shaking thing. Eh? God making, you know, God, you know, are making things to happen that, that will surpass the wisdom of men. That will surpass what logical reasoning cannot do. That will surpass, that will surpass what human intelligence can predict. Eh? It is not something that, that is, that is happening fresh. For example, um, outbreak of disease that will lead to lock up and lock down that happened with the coronavirus. Eh? That has happened before. That has happened in history. There have been lockdowns in history before. But what made coronavirus look very, very strange, eh? Was that it was not expected. It was not expected that, ah! This is going to take place. That's what I'm trying to say. Eh? It is this matter of the unexpected that I'm talking about, that I want to talk about to you today, as a young man, as a young woman. Eh? That, it is becoming more and more important, eh? For us as young people, to begin to operate in the dimension that the Bible actually predicted upon our young people. The Bible says it will come to pass in the last day that I will pour out my fruit upon our flesh, It says your sons and daughters, they will prophesy. It says your young men, , they will see vision one thing about a young man is the ability to see afar and I'm telling you today as a young man, as a young woman if you don't come into this oppression, which is not by human intelligence, but by the reason of inspiration and revelation so many things will take you unaware that your life will enter into a famine that you may not be able to come out of you need to understand the times you need to understand that we are entering a period in history that we need young men that can see what is to come we need young men, we need young women we need a category of young people that can survive the unexpected we need young people that can survive the unexpected we need people that the unexpected will not take unaware oh, are you understanding me young man? eh? people that the unexpected will not take unaware that the unexpected for men will be will be what they have expected oh are you getting me young man, young woman that is listening to me eh? I am saying that as a young man, as a young woman if you must survive the now that we are in the now that the globe is going through the now that Nigeria is going through the now that, you know is becoming a global phenomenon eh? what made coronavirus to be something that became so devastating particularly in Europe was that it was not expected if it had been expected it would have prepared and let me tell you why I am talking about this for you as a young man is because even you have been taken home eh? will happen unexpectedly oh even you have been taken home to be with the Lord eh? is something that the Bible says the Bible says when they will be saying eh? peace and safety the Bible says suddenly destruction will come upon them eh? like travel upon a woman eh? he said but you, you are not of the night that that day should take you unaware what I am trying to say is that even I have been taken home by rapture is something that will also happen in the future and will also happen in this unexpected way for those who are not aware so what I am trying to say that just like I have been taken away like rapture eh? the events of today they are events like that the happening that are happening to us around the globe today they are happening that are coming unexpectedly they are things that I just ah another thing another event outbreak of this disease eh? a sudden change in government policy a change in this a sudden that what you have expected you will be going this way just as you turn and flick on that direction and then you are wondering how is it going to be some are really committing suicide they could not respond appropriately some the Americans are scathing eh? some young men some young men are you know are getting confused and perplexed some are thinking that ah you know ah a drug addiction that will solve their problem some are thinking oh let me make all kinds of money and let me do yahoo to solve to solve the problem let me do something people are just responding to the unexpected differently some are responding by crying are we going to cry? some are responding by look look ah look prostitution is the way forward some are responding by all kinds of responses to several unexpected things because several young people are not prepared they are not prepared some have become so addicted to drugs because they are trying to cope because they don't know how to cope they don't even understand what to do the whole thing is confusing and perplexing eh? some are despair of life why? and I am telling you eh? why? because the thing came unexpectedly they have plans they have goals they have things that are put in place but they do not understand eh? that the things that are happening goes beyond what your understanding can handle eh? your understanding cannot handle the several unexpected things that are going on and I want to make reference to to you know familiar familiar stories in the bible familiar stories in the bible eh? familiar stories in the bible eh? familiar stories in the bible eh? as a way of making us to understand some of these things eh? the kind of young men that we need today eh? the kind of young men that we need today that's why our topic is young man young woman young people understand the time understand the time youth of today understand the time don't just live casually and carelessly eh? don't just live anyhow don't just live anyhow eh? don't live anyhow the the eh? there is a need there is a need for us there is a need for us eh? so so so so to undo so to undo what is happening around us what is happening around us appropriately appropriately and how do we do so? and how do we do so? and how do we do so? and how do we do so? how do we do so? let me show you something in the bible let me show you something in the bible let me show you something in the bible that's why that's why I'm telling you that that's why I'm telling you that there is nothing new there is nothing new on that story eh? eh? the various things that are happening today the various things that are happening today they are not new they are not necessarily new And the reason why you must, why as a Christian young man, as a Christian young woman, you stand a better chance is that you need to begin to understand that this is exactly how rapture too will take place. So that you must be somebody who can be watchful, who can be vigilant, who can understand timing. Because if you are not watchful, if you are not vigilant, you are not understanding timing, it is almost also definitely certain that as every other event are taking you nowhere, rapture is going to take you unaware. It's going to take you unaware. You must, you must, you must, you must BREATHE UP! You must BREATHE UP quickly! BREATHE UP! Young man, young woman, BREATHE UP! It is a time to BREATHE UP! It's a time to BREATHE UP! And understand timing. It's a time to BREATHE UP! And understand timing. BREATHE UP! BREATHE UP! BREATHE UP! BREATHE UP! BREATHE UP! Very, very crucial. Look at what happened in the Bible. I just want to show you to, you know, a familiar incident that we are very, very familiar with in Genesis. Look at Genesis. Huh? Genesis, I'm going to, I'm going to what happened between Joseph and Joseph. What happened between Joseph, Pharaoh's house, and his brothers. Just for you to get an understanding of what I'm trying to say. You know. And after that again, I will quickly turn, I will quickly turn to go to, to go to Daniel. We'll look at something there too. And then we'll have been, we'll have been through today. We'll have been through for this morning. Huh? I just want to show you, it's just a bargain I want to share with you. Something to, for you to go and be reflecting on. And the first thing I want you to reflect on very, very seriously is that if you cannot undo the unexpected, you are likely to misrapture. That's the first thing I want you to go home and be thinking about. Go home and be thinking seriously about it. If you don't, if you don't grow up, if you don't grow up, Bible says, you know, grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord. If you don't grow up in this to increase your capacity, you don't grow up in this to increase your capacity. Eh? Then this capacity cannot take you. There is a capacity. The Lord want us to grow. The Lord don't want us to remain as babes. Don't be a babe with the Lord. Grow. The Bible says He gave gifts unto men. Some to be apostles. Some to be prophets. Some to be evangelists. Some to be pastors. Some to be teachers. For what purpose? For the perfecting of the saints. In view of the work of the ministry. I'm quoting Ephesians chapter 4 from verse 11. In view of the work of the ministry. Eh? For the edification, for the build up of the body of Christ. Till we all come to the unity of the faith. Eh? Unto the knowledge of the Son of God. Unto a perfect man. Unto the measure of the fullness. Of the stature of Christ. So you see that God gave gifts for us to grow in and increase capacity. You can't continue to remain as a babe. You must grow up. You must grow up to be somebody eh? That can oppress. See where you are to oppress? Where are you to oppress as a young man? The Bible says our sons and daughters to be prophets. They are able to tell the mind of God. By the reason of the word of God. They will tell the mind of God. And secondly, they will see vision. I'm not talking of eh? Seeing one goat and one eh? Butterfly flying in your backyard. That's what I'm talking about. I'm not talking of eh? Seeing eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Vision of eh? I was, I was, I was in one aeroplane. And then Sister Funka was in another aeroplane. Aeroplane. The aeroplane. The aeroplane landed in the seaport of Nigeria. Or in the airport of Nigeria. That's where we are married. I'm not against marriage anyway. That's what I'm talking about. I'm only saying that. I'm talking about ability to see into the mind of God. That's what I'm talking about. Ability to see into the things of God. Ability to see into what God is doing. Ability to, to, to understand what God is saying. Eh? That's, that's what I, that's what I am, I'm, I'm, you know. I'm talking about. That, that's what I'm talking about. Huh? That's what I'm talking about. So you know, as a young person you say, I was young man we see vision. Look at Genesis eh, the, the, the Genesis that I, I, I was trying to make you look, look at just now. Eh? Genesis chapter eh? Let me close with Genesis. Genesis chapter 4. Let me close with Genesis. chapter 40, then we enter into 41. Because the matter began to operate from that point. Look again at chapter 40. Chapter 40. We take it from verse 9. It says, then the sheep butler thought his dream to Joseph. And Joseph said to him, Behold, in my dream, and he said to Joseph, Behold in my dream, a vine was before me and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded. It blossomed shortfall and its cluster brought forth ripe grain. The inferno's cup was in my hand and I took the grain and pressed them into the inferno's cup and placed the cup in the inferno's hand. And Joseph said to him, this is the interpretation of it, the three branches are three days. Now within three days, the inferno will lift up your head and restore to you and restore you to your place. And you will be put in and you will put the inferno's cup in his hand according to the former manner when you were his butler. But remember, when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me, make mention of me to Pharaoh and get me out of this place. Now he interpreted to the butler, to the baker. When the sheep baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream and there were three white baskets on my head. In the upper baskets were full of all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh. And the birds, the birds ate them out of the baskets on my head. So Joseph answered and said to him, this is the interpretation of it, the three baskets are three days. Within three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and hang you on a tree and the birds will eat your flesh from you. Now it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants and he lifted up the head of the sheep baker's butler. And the sheep baker, among his servants, then he restored the sheep butler to his butler's sheep again. And he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand, but he hung the sheep baker as Joseph has interpreted to them. Now, what am I trying to make you see? I'm showing you a young girl. Now, there were men who saw three branches and they were perplexed by the branches. They saw an event, an incident in their life, they could not interpret. Eh? When the man, the butler saw it, eh? If you go back, if you go to verse 9, sorry, verse 6 of that chapter 40, I want to show you something. It says, and Joseph came in to them in the morning. And look at them and saw that they were sad. Eh? What happened to these two men? They were sad. I want to ask you, these two men, they were responding to the situation of life. How? How were they responding? They were responding the same way. Am I correct? Am I correct? Yes. same way. They were responding the same way, unfortunately. Let's read on. Eh? It shouldn't have been so. It was so unfortunate. Let's read on. He said they were sad. So he asked them, that was Joseph. Joseph asked several officers who were with him in the custody of the Lord's house, saying, why do you look so sad today? Why do you look so sad today? And they said to him, we each have a dream and there is no interpreter of it. So Joseph said to them, do not interpretations belong to God. Tell them to me, please. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. They were facing similar life situations. They both had dreams. Eh? But responding the same way. It was an unfortunate situation. Unfortunate because the response of the butler should have been different from the response of the baker. Oh! Are you understanding me? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Of the butler should have been different from the response of the baker. When the butler had that dream, the butler ought to start jumping. He ought to start rejoicing. Triumph in his life. See even type of worship song. Salvation. I thank you for the mercy that I've received. I thank you for what you are doing in my life. I thank you for the height that you are taking me to. That ought to be the response of the butler. But unfortunately, the butler was sad. Eh? The butler was responding as a baker. He was at the same category with them. The same category with them. With him. Why was he at the same category with him? Eh? Because he does not understand the time. He does not understand the time. Many, many Christian youths today I see many Christian youths today responding the same way like every other man. Because they don't understand the time. Many, many, many, many Christian youths today. Young men and young women calling conflict racing what people are calling conflict racing. Fearing what people fear. Running just like running with every youth. You know, butlers running also like bettors. Morose, sad, depressed. Responding the way they ought not to have responded. Because they could not interpret the time. They could not understand the time. And in the same way, eh? You also find that because there is no interpretation, eh? As it is for men who ought to triumph, so it is for men eh? Eh? Who ought not triumph. They are in the same category. Solomon said something. He said, I saw something, a particular evil under heaven. Eh? The princes, it happened to princes just like ordinary men. What am I trying to make you understand? Eh? I am saying that young men, young women, I am talking of, I am addressing the believer. I am addressing that brother, that sister, who said he had an encounter with Jesus. I am addressing you. I am addressing you that have hope. That you are not like the baker that have no hope. That death have been destined for. Eh? You may be having similar dreams. Just like the baker, that have no hope. The baker is having a similar dream. But because you could not interpret the dream, eh? Your situation, the happiness around your life due to your committing suicide. Due to your giving up hope. Due to your reacting to your situation. You are reacting to the dreams of your life. You are reacting to things happening around you just the way the baker was reacting. This was a, you see, this was all the people. What about coronavirus? Coronavirus. So why is it that you, I am dying. I am dying. What is happening? I can't do something. I am dying. Because there is no interpretation. Because there is no interpretation. Young woman, wake up from your sleep. Young woman, wake up from your sleep. The Bible says we know that all people work together for good. Stand up in that college today. Can you stand up in that mic today? capacity today i begin to respond to your dreams differently from the baker i'm talking about interpretation i'm talking about the young youth please understand the time youth understand the time i'm going to share this body with you so that we pray this morning i will i will close this meeting i want you to go home and think that if you cannot interpret events like this if you cannot interpret apple is around you you are not likely also to be part of those that will go with the rapture wake up unto righteousness young woman young man wherever you are listening to me this morning wherever you are listening to me please wake up i don't see you wake up i just came this morning to come and wake you up from your slumber that goes on this single's club for this saturday it's a wake-up call young man young woman wake up it is not going to be to the butler as it's going to be for the baker the bible says ah talking about the believer he says even when there is death he says we should not sorrow as those that have no hope we are different categories of different categories of people we are different categories of people he said we should not sorrow those that have no hope that even when we die we know that because the lord jesus came you know rose from the dead we are sure that when he comes we that are dead we rise up first we will you know to meet the lord in this kind god that i like that will join us we know even in death we are not hopeless to talk about when we say have life i'm talking about understanding the time understanding the time pretending the time it's like it's like you just you just forgot that your father he's the one who is the universe. Who propel, who sustain, who maintain the universe by the word of His power. The acting to think that everything in the universe is just happening by chance. How are you living? How are you thinking? Butlers acting like bakers because there is no interpretation. Butlers, butlers, butlers, sorrowful, depressed, responding to the situation. Now we throw away all of these things. In fact, there is no hope for me again. In fact, I am just in 200 level now. See what is going to happen to my life? We just begin to throw away everything. See now, my job cannot do this, my life cannot do that. And all kinds of things, all kinds of negative pronouncement, confession, things that people are saying today. And you see, you see, you keep wondering, where is our God in the whole of it? It is important to know this. But you know, Joseph said something. He said something. And that is what, you know, the first challenge I am giving you. Please, I am giving you two challenges now. The first one is if you cannot see vision, if you cannot see ahead, if you cannot understand that, you know, things will not be new. It is only that they will be new. They will be unexpected. And be able to see. So that things don't take you unaware. You are likely to miss the rapture. That was my first challenge. The second challenge I am giving you is that there are many of us today, post-life, that are responding to situations like Baker's. That is my second challenge to you. Eh? That is my second challenge to you. I am just trying to show you the line of the challenge so that you don't miss the emphasis of today's message. The line of the challenge. So that you don't miss the emphasis of today's message. The line of the challenge. Then look at the third thing I want to show you. Eh? The third line of challenge. Ah? That is, then, the sheep, the, um, sorry, what Joseph said. And they said to him, we each have, we each have had a dream. And there is no interpretation of it. So Joseph said to them, do not interpretations belong to God. Hallelujah. Interpretations belong to God. And I want to ask you, who is God to you? If God is your Father, eh? If God is actually your Father, Should you be far from interpretation? Are you listening to me, young people? Are you following me, young man? Are you understanding me this morning, young man? Are you understanding me? Are you following me? Are you taking time to follow what I am saying? Are you taking time to do so? Are you taking time to listen, to listen correctly? Are you taking time to do so? My question is, if God is your father, should interpretation be far from you? Interpretation belongs to God. Eh? Do not interpretations belong to God? Do not interpretations belong to God? Do not interpretations belong? Interpretations belong to God? Brother! Interpretations belong to God. The confusion in your life is as a result of lack of communion with God. That's what I am telling you. The confusion that you are facing is due to lack of communion with God. The confusion around your soul today is due to lack of communion with God. not today, you have not taken time to learn the art of communion with God. The art of creating time to be with God. The art of spending time in meditation, in prayer, in communion, in responding to God in this world. You have not taken time to develop that capacity. You have not taken time to have a consistent work with Jesus. Brother, the confusion in your life, I'm telling you the source of your confusion. The source of your confusion is that all this why. When you ought to be a teacher, you see how that man should teach you over and over and over again the basic principles of the kingdom. When you ought to begin to increase, you ought to begin to, you see, this is something you should, you know, I tell people that, you know, the regiments of our Christian life belong to God. You ought to begin with learning to work with God. What do I apologize to what happens to us today in our churches? Where Christianity is zero into activity. Huh? There's another problem again for the person who got born again, who thinks that everything about God is just some activity. Huh? But it transcends that. I'm not against that. I'm only saying that Christianity transcends that. The faith of what a young believer should know is how to work with God by the reason of the word of God. How to learn the art of basic daily quiet time with God. How to stay with God and by the word of God begin to learn how to work with God. How to daily respond to God's word in his word. How to meditate on it and believe that, look, the promises that I hear, they are for my life. The instructions I hear, they are for me. The promises that I hear, they are for me. The connections I hear, they are for me. They are not for information. They form a lifestyle for me. And as they form their lifestyle gradually, they begin to enter into higher realm. Huh? Of adding impressions, intuitions, revelations, inspirations. It begins from that regiment. But many of these are not learned today. The solution in your life is lack of communion with God. What I'm telling you, my thoughts are linked to you, young man. My young woman, is that interpretation belongs to God. Understanding of the times belongs to God. Huh? If God is your father, interpretation should not be something you lack. When they told, when they told, when they told Joseph the dream, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, what did he say you see? Oh, you saw three, you saw three, three branches, okay, they blossomed, and then you saw like you took a cup. Huh? All those things that you are seeing as three days, they actually represent days. Hallelujah. Ah! The man was seeing trees, but actually they were days. Huh? You can never comprehend, you know, three branches to become three days except by the Spirit of God. Huh? Who can see good is that coronavirus except by the Spirit of God? Who can see direction? Inside, inside, as soon, academic start confusion except by the Spirit of God. Who can, who can get, who can get the right interpretation of what to do and how to do it? A strike, you don't know when it is going off. So, if it is going off tomorrow night, it's going to be catastrophic for some people. If it is going to go off, you don't even know when it is going to, so it's going, the calling of God is going to come unexpected. Are you understanding me? They are not in me. They have been before. But what is making all these things to be like this? Huh? Is the unexpectedness. The unexpectedness is when different things are coming in. Huh? As they are coming out of one, you are going into another. You are coming out of one. The nations of the world are going to different things today. They are not necessarily new things. But the way they are falling in and out, they are falling in. They are falling in such a way that they bring a lot of suddenness. They bring a lot of things. Around the life of people, that is, you know, causing trepidations, that is causing alarm, that can make people to wonder, how is it going to be? How is it going to look like? How is it going to be? How is it going to go? And sometimes, when it is going to go like this, it does not go like that, it goes another way again. Because the responses to these things will not be exactly the same way. The responses to them will not be exactly the same way. Huh? The responses to them may not be exactly the same. And that is the second thing I want to show you as we try to close. Huh? The responses will not be exactly the same way. That is the second thing I want to show you. The second episode which will be my fourth challenge to you. And that will be the final theme for today. Huh? And then we will pray. Huh? Now, the issue of the dream, Joseph interpreted. And then it happened to the butler as he had interpreted, and then to the baker as he had interpreted. Now, I want to call your mind to something very, very crucial. If you are a good student of the Bible, you will know that there was a famine in the days of Abraham. If you go to the earlier chapters in Genesis, when Abraham got to the land of Canaan, there was famine in that land. If you look at Genesis chapter 12, verse 10, God told Abraham to move to a land, that was the land of Canaan. You will know that he got to where he ought to be. And the Lord had already spoken to him. Look at it in verse 7, it's on the land of Canaan, where God wants them to dwell. Genesis chapter 12, verse 7. Then the Lord appeared to Abraham and said, to your descendants I will give this land. And there, he built an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. So you discover that when God told him to go, he was already in the place where he ought to be. Now, in that place where he ought to be, there was a famine. You will see that in the verse 10. Saying now, there was famine in the land. And Abraham went down to Egypt to dwell there. For the famine was severe. Now, when the famine was severe, Abraham responded the way he could. But of course, God showed up to Abraham and told him to go back to that land. He ought not to have moved down to Egypt. Now, you will see that when the famine took place, Abraham went by going down to Egypt. That was his response. In Genesis chapter 26 again, you have a similar thing. Genesis 26, there was famine again. Abraham responded by going down to Egypt. In Genesis chapter 12, Abraham went down to Egypt. Now, when we come to Genesis chapter 26, we see, we are looking at another person again. This is the son of Abraham. There was famine again beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. You see, the Bible makes reference to that. I'm showing you a consistent thing. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philippians in Gera. Then the Lord appeared to Isaac. Do not go down to Egypt. Have you seen Isaac? What did he want to do? He wanted to go down to Egypt. He wanted to respond again like his father. He wanted to respond like his father. At this time around, God had to quickly warn Isaac. Don't behave like your papa. Don't go that direction. He didn't go well with Abraham in going down to Egypt. Stay in this land and we bless you. Isaac was able to get an interpretation. And in verse 13 of chapter 26, the Bible says, and the Lord blessed him. Because he lived a hundredfold. Now, I want you to be looking at this response. That the response to the famine in the days of Isaac was that he should sow it in that land and he would live a hundredfold. He should not go to Egypt. Now, look at Genesis 41. I'm just dealing with the matter of famine. The first thing I'm trying to make you see is that how big that was famine a new thing is also something new. So, what I'm only showing you understanding the time and how to respond to them. That's what I'm showing you. Eh? That responses at different times may not be the same way. You must understand how you have to respond in your own time. That's what I'm talking about. About young man, wake up. They are willing me not to strike. But the way your elder brother responded in 1995. If you go and do that today, you may perish. That's what I'm saying. When I do strike, you can count the number of assholes that I will have today. Eh? You can count the number of you know, all kinds of disease that have befallen nations. And things you can count different things today. War, all that adversity. Things that have happened, there's nothing new. But I'm talking of responding appropriately. That's what I'm talking about. There are appropriate ways to respond. The appropriateness for Abraham was that he should not have gone to Egypt, but he went. Unfortunately, things did not really work as well for him in going to Egypt. That's when he got there, you see all kinds of life compromise and all of that that happened to him. Said, that is my sister. Instead of his wife, I'll give her. And that was when he got egged. To be at Egypt, you know, because you know, until you were born, you were born in Egypt, and you know what the people is born of. And then you are born again in Egypt. But no one said something like that. And then you were born again in Egypt. And you know, today, man, they say that you are born again in Egypt. And now you're born again in Egypt. And you were born again in Egypt, but you were born again in Egypt. And you have grown as an Egyptian and you know what it will later happen. Others don't agree on becoming a challenge to the what I did is, he got an appropriate response for his own time. The response was so inside the farmer, I will bless you. Now when we come to Genesis, Genesis 41, a different ball game entirely. This time, it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream. He dreamed again a new thing again. No, I was talking about a dream before. That's why there's nothing new under the sun. There's nothing new under the sun. And behold, he stood by a river. You know this, you know everything that follows. Eh? That by the river, seven cows tried looking and passed. And then, and they said in the deal, then behold, seven other cows came up. They ate up that first one and then, he didn't look at if there was anything good about those cows. The same thing again. Eh? For, for, you know, when they ate up the final one, it looked as if there was nothing there. He had the dream again a second time. This time not with cows. Eh? But with, eh, with plants. Eh? Seven good ones again. Then seven bad ones. And you can see that the seven those good ones, eh, never happened. And then they could not interpret. And then again, you saw the, the young man, Joseph. Eh? Joseph saw again, he interpreted for Pharaoh. And he told him that look, this, this dream happened twice. It means, it is certain. It's going to happen. Eh? I'm showing you, eh, oh, may God give us men who can understand time. Eh? I'm showing you young people. All of this happened before this young man was 30. He was in his 20s when these things were going on. And you find, you find people today confused, perplexed, bastard. I'm a believer, I'm a Christian, and you keep wondering. You keep wondering. Wondering where is direction? Where is direction for our young people today? People say when, when Joseph became Pharaoh, eh, when he became a prime minister in Egypt, he was 30. So all of these things took place before he was 30. Giving direction to, to men. To elders, to orchisers, to this, to that, to that. Interpreting for men, giving himself. Hallelujah. Look at what happened. And then they called Joseph. Joseph gave interpretation. I'm not, I don't want to look at the matter of interpretation again. We have talked about that. I'm not, I don't want to look at the matter of interpretation again. We have talked about that. I'm not, I don't want to look at the matter of interpretation again. We have talked about that. I'm not, I don't want to look at the matter of interpretation again. We have talked about that. But what I want to show you is looking at something in the family history. Eh? In the family history, their great-great-grandfather, there was someone. He responded foolishly. The son that followed wanted to respond. He responded by wanting to do like his father. Thank God for interpreting, for interpretation. Whatever to understand that. When it came to, this time now, to Jacob. When it came to, this time now, to Jacob. He wanted to do like his father and his children. Eh? It's going to be a different transport. Eh? The matter was that, this time around. They must not stay inside the famine and plan to. Joseph told them. That this thing is going to continue. There're still another seven years of famine. Look, if you don't leave Cana. If you don't leave that promised land now and come to Egypt. And this is a different body. Ah! God told my forefathers not to go there Abraham went there It was not well with him My grandfather too wanted to go God rebuked him from going I must not go If I go there it will not be well with me If Jacob have not Left that promised land for Egypt It would not be the purpose of God For their life They would not have perished in Canaan The response of this famine Is that the whole household Must leave the promised land They must not even Leave anybody there All of them must come To Egypt They should come and stay in the land of Goshen They should stay there And the famine Continued like that And just affect them And the program of God was that They will still be there for another 400 years That is where they will multiply And become a mighty nation I am showing you understanding The time So that my grandfather did it That is what I am going to do I remember My grandfather told me When there was outbreak of disease in their time This is what they did Dick is how they did it And so we did it like this That is how we are going to do it My brother, my sister It will not be exactly like that The response of the famine of your time Might be different from the way your grandfather responded Your father responded The way you are going to respond to that Because that was exactly what Joseph told them And everybody had to leave Canaan Everybody came down to Egypt And they were fed by Joseph Mind you That was the plan Joseph told them When he revealed himself to his brother That was exactly what he told them He said look You think that I came here ordinarily I came here ordinarily No Don't think that way Don't think that way at all The truth is that You know You intend this thing for evil But God meant it for good And so He has brought me here So that everything Can be well with us That is why I am here That is why we are all here That is why we are all here Look at what he said I want to show you that 3D In verse I want to take you to Verse chapter 44 Chapter 44 Now I go to chapter 44 And then Sorry Let me take No chapter 45 please Chapter 45 From verse 1 He said then Joseph could not restrain himself Before all those who stood by him And he cried out to God And he cried out to God Make everyone go out from me And he cried out to God And he cried out to God Make everyone go out from me So So No one stood with him While Joseph made himself known to his brother And he wept aloud And he just sent at the house of Pharaoh Heard it When Joseph said to his brother I am Joseph Does my father still live? But his brother could not answer him For they were dismayed in his presence And Joseph said to his brother Please Come near me So they came near Then he said I am Joseph your brother Will be sold into Egypt But now do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourself because you showed me here for god sent me before you to do what to preserve life the agenda of god this time is that all of them must leave egypt must leave canada and come to egypt god has sent somebody there to go and preserve them that was the agenda of god this time so if he said that look abraham wanted to go and god you see what happened from that thing was not good uh you see when has he wanted to go in fact god appeared to him and god warned my father isaac don't go to egypt stay in this land me i'm not going to go there is a tradition in our family there is a this in our hometown there is that in my church there is this in our denomination you may die it's not about tradition and it's not about tradition and living on your understanding it's about understanding the time here to preserve life for these two years the famine has been in the land and they are still five years in which they will neither be plowing or harvesting so this time it's not so in the land and you will leave a hundred food this time no planting no harvesting no planting no harvesting that one is so in the land and i will and i will bless you that's what god told isaac so in the land and i will bless you you can read up that story this time the arrangement was that they have stored all food in egypt that food is what people will feed them for the next five years that's what god told them oh yeah stop stop stop stop this time around the response to this family there will be no there will be no planting or others so if you want to say i will stay in canada and then i will sell because my father i did so in the land the lord bless him and leave 100 fold don't worry i'll read 100 fold sorry you're not even on the prime fold because that's not the agenda of god what i'm trying to say that interpretation belongs to god the response to different situations are not going to be the same and you must be able to i'm talking about being able to see young man being able to see he says they'll be able to see the truth they will not be able to see because that's There will be no other plowing nor harvesting. God sent me before you to preserve a posterity for you in the earth. And to save your life by great deliverance. So the great deliverance of God is everybody leave Cana and come where? Come to Egypt. That's the deliverance of God. May we not miss his deliverance. May we not miss his deliverance. I'm telling you that God has deliverance for every situation. The Bible says God will not allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear. But with every temptation, there is a what? A way of escape. There is a way of escape. Whatever you had this morning, I want you to start praying. Lord, interpretation belongs to you. My life must not be in darkness. In my own time too. Asus strike is not just happening now. Outbreak of Gideon is not in. A bad government in Nigeria. This is not the first time. We have Abasha one time. We have Baba Gita. We have been having different things you describe as bad, bad, bad government. And even the present one is saying that Gita government was a bad one. Therefore it's a bad government. But our responses to this thing is very, very important. How do we respond to bad government? How do we respond to mismanagement? How do we respond? How do we respond to mismanagement? How do we respond to mismanagement? How do we respond to this thing that we are facing in Nigeria? What is the way out of God for now? That is what I'm talking about. What is the way out? What is the way forward for me as a young man at a time like this? What is the way out? They are talking about Islamization. Islamization has been something that has always been cried in Nigeria. That there is a time to Islamize. These are not new phenomenons. But I am asking what is your response as a young man? How are you going to respond to this? That is what is important to me. Are you going to respond to all of these things? Are you going to respond? Will we respond as bakers? Should the butler be responding as the baker? Should Jacob be responding as Isaac? Should Isaac be responding as Abraham? Look, these are the points I'm trying to make. Young person, understand the time. Young person, understand the time. Understand the time. Understand the time. The first thing I told you as we close this morning, since I want you to take it, if you don't begin to understand the time, you are likely to miss the rapture. You are likely to miss the rapture. The second thing I told you as something to go home and think about is that unfortunately, bakers, butlers are responding as bakers. Butlers are supposed to be rejoicing in their dreams. Eh? Eh? responding as bakers because they lack interpretation uh the third thing the third challenge i gave you is that interpretation belong to god if you cannot interpret if you cannot interpret eh you need to ask you are you working with god the third thing i showed you the fourth thing i showed you is that the response of different generations differs from one another how you will respond to this there are no new things but your response it is how we respond to them eh the responses are not the same almighty god we thank you for this morning lord we thank you for this morning i've just shared shared oh god a body with our younger generation i've just shared a body oh god with them how they need to work out of their slumber they need to get up and gain their life for their life they need not to just sit down there sit down there perplexed and confused oh lord god almighty i pray god almighty god almighty by the power of your spirit it is you that work in us both to will and to do of your good pleasure wake up our young people wake up our wake up our young people wake up our young men wake up our young women wake them up from their slumber let them live correctly and appropriately at a time like this oh god in their name of jesus christ oh lord i pray none of us will miss your deliverance in every situation there is a way out oh god that's your way out none of us will miss it neither they nor with the other generation we will not miss this oh god in the name of jesus our eyes on you oh lord our eyes on you oh lord oh god efforts that will not work in darkness who will not work in darkness grant us life and direction in the name of jesus Jesus Christ thank you eternal father in Jesus name we pray let's share the grace together in Fellowship the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ the love of God and the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us now and forevermore Amen this message is coming to you from Family Tenth Ministry a Christian ministry involved in enriching the lives of singles and marriage through preaching and teaching of God's word discipleship family life enrichment social and Community development and mission heat our regular activities are discipleship class every Monday 5 p.m Adolescent and singles club of every month at 10 a.m marriage forum second Saturday of every month at 10 a.m family life seminars regular school outreaches and everyday counseling for further counseling you can reach us at our location live camp by the first Bridge community opposite the rejoicing station along Nigeria you can also reach us through our social media handles familytenth at yahoo.co.uk familytenth ministry whole1hygiene.com www.familytenthministry.org our phone numbers are 0A03386113607031613848 familytenth ministry whole1hygiene.com www.familytenth ministry whole1hygiene.com our phone numbers are 0A03386113607031613848 familytenth ministry whole1hygiene.com our phone numbers are 0A03386113607031613848 familytenth ministry whole1hygiene.com our phone numbers are 0A03386113607031613848\"}\n",

These people will not expect to just be coming up and they will be having serious implications in terms of the politics of the nations, in terms of the economy of the nations, in terms of the security of the nations, in terms of the peace of the nations, in terms of stability of the nations, in terms of, just mention, every ramification of society. In terms of family structure, family life, everything put together, they will be having implications. So, one important reason why you must be understanding the times, which I mentioned in the month of August, is that look, you must be careful that even the rapture itself is going to be something that will happen to the world unexpectedly. Do not understand it. If you are understanding the times, it means as if it will happen to the world. That is how it is going to happen to you. It will miss the world unexpectedly. But if you are understanding the times, then it becomes an impossibility for the rapture to meet you unawares. So, I said one major thing, young man and young woman, why you must be taking time to understand the times, is that why several things will be happening, like it happened with Coronavirus. Other things are still coming up. Other things are in line. Things that will look strange and sudden. Things that will look unexpectedly. Having serious implications for society. Having serious implications for men and women. Having serious implications for the family. Having serious implications even for the church. For fellowship. For Christianity. For Christian life. The same way the rapture too will take place. Having serious implications for the Christian life. So, it is very very important that the young man and the young woman should be able to understand the times. To be able to understand the times is very very very very important. And lastly, I did note, in the month of August, that the things that will be happening will not be completely new things. As new things under heaven. For instance, even the rapture is not a completely new thing. Elijah had been taken to heaven before. So, it is not a completely new thing. Enoch worked with God. He preached God and God took him away. So, the rapture is not a completely new thing. Some people have experienced similar things before. Eh? Being caught up by the Spirit. Philip had experienced it. Philip experienced it. Philip had experienced that. So, it is not something that is completely new. So, I said something in the month of August. That the things that will be happening is not assumed they will be completely new. But it is the suddenness, the unexpected that will be taking place. I noted in the month of August that when you look at the life of Joseph, you look at the life of Isaac. Eh? We use that to illustrate something. I am giving this background because I want to give response to a question that generated from the month of August. That is what I want to do today with today's Singles Club. A question came up. How do we follow the Lord? Eh? How do we follow Him? Following the Lord. That is our focus for this September. Eh? So, I am trying to bring together those of us who may just be joining us today. Joining us on miss live. Joining us on telegram. I want to give a background. And then we pray briefly. And then we look into how do we follow the Lord in the midst of all of this. Of course, following the Lord will not take us just one day. It will not take us just today teaching. It may take us two or three meetings. I don't know. As the Lord will be helping us. But I just want to try to see how I can respond to a question that followed last month's teaching. How do we follow the Lord? Sir, how do I follow the Lord? So, I am going to give a background to what led to that question. And then I will try to see how I place, how I begin to answer giving some important landmarks today. And if there are questions. You know, we also take them. And I did want to say that please, if you have any questions, if you are on telegram, you can place your question there immediately. You can always place your question on telegram. As the question comes to your mind, place it on telegram. The technicals, we always send it to us. The Twitter can also be on our WhatsApp group. You can put the question there if you come to us. If you are on our family-themed WhatsApp group. The question can also come on MissLab. We will get the question. If you send your question on any of these three platforms, we will definitely get it. And we will see how we attend to that question. So, as I was saying, I said it's not necessarily something new. That's what I was trying to explain. And we use the man, we use Isaac. We use Isaac. In relation to the matter of Joseph also. We notice that in the month of August, we notice, we look first at the life of Abraham. The Bible says there was a famine in the time of Abraham. And Abraham went to Egypt. But God told him to leave Egypt and then he came back again to Canaan. And then in the days of Isaac, there was a similar famine again. So it's nothing new. There was famine again in the days of Isaac. And this time, Isaac also wanted to go ahead like his father. He wanted to go to Egypt. But God appeared to Isaac. And he said, look, don't go. Isaac was able to understand. Don't go the path your father went. Stay in this land. I do not want you to stay in this land. I do not want Abraham to leave Canaan. He left Canaan. You don't leave Canaan. Stay in this land. I'm going to give you this land. I'm going to bless you. Stay in this land. So Isaac wanted to respond to the famine by leaving for Egypt. But thank God, as a young man, he was able to understand the situation. He was able to understand the time. And so the response was, don't go. So he stayed in the land. So that is, he went back to Egypt. He went to賢abu. Where did he go to? Another land. Until all of them were gone. He went to Gergai. He went to the following lands, he went to the land. He went to Jerusalem. He went to Ephraim, where they go back. He went to allen regan. He went to manila and he went to Hamun. So after he went to Baraam. How many friends are there at theison to become Uzzah Tant lähok Sugp or not? At least a few friends. He went to sileog, land, to hold off from Uzzah. And then they went to Noah. The base of these lands. Abraham took Alamabu. He went to Habanaki. was look you and all your family you and all your household everybody living nothing everybody pack everything that you have go down to egypt go and stay in egypt and i said if jacob did not understand you know you know if jacob was not able to understand the time he would have been saying god told my grandfather my great-grandfather not to go to egypt god told my father isaac not to go to egypt me too i'm not going though that is not the way to you know in our family nobody goes out of egypt nobody goes out of canada they must stay in canada they must not enter egypt jacob and all his children and everybody would have died so you see that incident but different responses because what happened this young people this may be able to understand the time you don't understand the time and i said why it is so important for us to for you as a young man as a young woman to to be understanding your time understanding things is because oh in your own time too different things will be happening will be coming up you'll begin to think that this is how they normally do it that's how i'm going to do it that's how you normally do it you must understand what the lord is telling you i'm able to respond correctly so that you don't have a real you don't have a wrong response to the things in your own time i pray that um we will be like the sons of isaac who have an understanding of the time to know what we ought to do in the name of jesus christ so it wasn't it wasn't in response to these things that we raised in the month of august that the question came up how do we follow the time and i first okay totally how do we follow the lord that was the question how do we follow the law and i said okay what is going to happen is that following the lord he said big topic on its own maybe instead of moving to something else in the month of september october november i don't know for um depending on how the lord will help us maybe we should try to respond to this question jointly uh and see how we look at how how how will a young man follow the lord how will a young woman follow how do we follow the lord so that we can understand the time how do we follow the law and that is the beginning that is what we want to focus with today so following the lord one is what we are looking at today wherever we get so in the month of um october we look at two and maybe we have three four five or maybe we stop at two three i don't know now but let's see how the lord will help us so i believe i've been able to bring all of us together those of us who may observe the company the background to what we want to do today and those of us who were here last month i believe i've been able to um also give a summary of what we did last month so let us have it um a short word of prayer and then we go in so responding to the question how will a youth how will you use how will a young man How should young people follow the Lord? How do we follow the Lord? Let us pray. Oh, our Father, we thank you. Our God, we give you glory. We give you honor. We give you praise. We commit today's singles club into your hand. Lord, we pray that as we gather to consider this important issue, how do we follow you? How can we follow you? Lord, we pray that you will grant seed to the sower. There will be bread for the eaters also in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, you will. You will. You will. You will, by yourself, help us to answer the question. You will help. You will help. We are at different level of maturity. So, Lord, I am praying that at everybody's level of maturity, Lord, you will meet with them in the name of Jesus Christ. For everyone joining us on Missla, everyone joining us on Telegram, we will physically hear. Lord, I pray. Meet with us. Meet with us in your own special room in the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Eternal Father. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. How do I, how do we follow the Lord? How do I follow the Lord? Now, on that way to look at following the Lord, is how do I walk with the Lord? Walking with the Lord. W-A-L-K. How do I walk with Him? Walking with the Lord. Following the Lord. Huh? And I want to begin like this. As I want to respond to the question, I want to begin with, uh, this general background in, uh, in Ecclesiastes. Let's see something in Ecclesiastes, just to buttress one or two points again, and then we'll move on from there. Uh, talking about the issue of, uh, time and season. In Ecclesiastes chapter 3 from verse 1, it says, The Bible says to everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven. To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven. A time to be born, a time to die, a time to plant, a time to pluck what is planted, a time to kill, a time to heal, a time to break up, to break down, a time to build up, a time to weep, a time to laugh, a time to mourn, a time to dance, a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stone. A time to embrace, a time to refrain from embracing, a time to gain, a time to loose, a time to keep, and a time to throw away. A time to cheer, a time to sow, So, a time to keep silent, a time to speak, a time to love, a time to hate, a time of war, and a time of peace. Now, the first thing I want you to appreciate as a young man is that our God is a God of time. And I want to let you know that there is nothing, I'm trying to look at it, there is nothing as wonderful as following the Lord in the days of your youth. There is a time for everything. And I'm trying to tell you that as a young man, this is the best. This is the best time to follow Him. That's the first thing I want to make you see. This is the best time. This is the best time. There is a time for everything. Now, to everything there is a season. And a time for every purpose under the sun. If you are asking me, when is the time to follow the Lord? Now, I'm telling you, young man, young woman that is listening to me. Oh! The days of our youth is the best of time to pursue the Lord. What I'm saying is that time is in your favor. Oh! In following the Lord. Oh! As a young man, as a young woman, the Bible says something again in Exodus chapter 12. You will find it there again in Exodus chapter 12. It says, remember now your Creator. Remember now your Creator. In the days of your youth. Remember now your Creator. In the days of your youth. Before the difficult days come. So, the first thing I want to open up with you this morning is that I congratulate you that you are asking me this question around this period of your own life. Oh! That how do I follow the Lord? That you are asking that this question is coming up in your mind now, and you are thinking of, oh, are you there to follow the Lord? How do I follow Him? Huh? That is coming to you and you are seeking for answers to such a question. I'm telling you, you are blessed. Honestly, you are a blessed person. Because from the point of this scripture, your Creator himself is telling you that, look, seek me while you are young. What I'm trying to say is that you are a blessed person. What I'm trying to make you see is that God himself is giving you an open check. You want to follow the Lord. I'm first trying to make you see that God himself is interested in your following Him. There is this interest of God. There is this purpose of God. There is this mindset of God. The mindset of God is that, look, remember me while you are young. Hallelujah. Remember me while you are young. Don't wait till you are old. While you are still young. Honestly, I want to be grateful to God that I met the Lord at the age of 17. That I met the Lord as a teenager. Honestly, it made a lot of difference. It made a lot of difference. It made a lot of difference. Huh? That before you enter, before you enter, before you have wasted so much part of your life, huh? Before you have done too many mistakes and you have gotten so many things wrong, you know, walking in darkness, huh? That at a very early age, you are meeting with the Lord. So, the first thing I want to open this answer with is that God himself is interested. Huh? The days of your youth is also the days to seek the Lord. Huh? What I'm trying to make you see very specifically is that the desire to pursue God as a young person, eh, is also agreeing with the mind of God that, look, you should seek me while you are young. So, following the Lord and desiring to know him, what I first want to tell you, is that it is the will of God for your life. What is the will of God? If you want to ask me, what is the will of God for my life as a young man? The will of God for your life is that you should follow him. The will of God for you is that you should walk with him. God wants you to come. So, God himself, what I'm trying to make you see, is that heaven, heaven is waiting for you to come. Huh? So, there is, there is abundance of God already prepared. So, there is, there is abundance of God already prepared. There is plenty in the house of God for you. That you are choosing to follow the Lord. God is delighted. God is happy. And I want to begin, continue with that, begin with that, in saying that, remember the case of the prodigal son. Huh? The prodigal son went away, walked away, was away, was misbehaving, walking in the bush, living the way he wanted, wasting resources, wasting time, wasting his life, living anyhow, pursuing, all kinds of fleshly lusts, living in, we're living a wasted life. The truth I want to make you see is that any life away from the Lord is a wasted life. Huh? Instead the young man said, Father, give me what belongs to me, I want to go. Every time a man goes away from God, not following the Lord, he's living a wasted life. It's a wasted life. So, the point I want to make you see is that, at the point when the young man said, Oh! I'm going back home. I want to go back home. You will notice that the response of the father was a great joy. The Bible says the father saw him from afar, the father jumped, and the father ran, the father went to meet him. Huh? Old people don't run. Huh? There must be something urgent that will make old people to run. Huh? They don't necessarily run. It is children that run unnecessarily. Huh? When a young man runs, he runs because there is a purpose. Not to talk of older men. Huh? The father ran to meet him. He ran. There was a running. Because something great was happening. What I'm trying to make you see is that when we say we want to... That's determination. When you are making up your mind that I want to follow the Lord. Huh? There is a response from heaven that says you are welcome. That's the first thing I want you to know. Don't let anything make you get discouraged, make you get afraid, make you feel that, oh, I want to follow God. Is God really? What is God saying? Does God want me to come? I am first telling you that know that you are making up your mind to follow God. The response you will get from God is wow! Come on! This man wants to follow me. There is a joy in heaven. He is rejoicing. And what brings that joy? That rejoicing? Step into following the Lord. Is that there is this place of fundamentally the first thing a man needs to do. Huh? The Lord said repent for the kingdom of God is at hand. I am reading from the most foundational level. There is a place of repentance. There is a place of saying I will follow the way of the world again. There is a place of making up your mind. There is a place of saying Lord, I am turning away from not following you. I am making up my mind to follow the Lord. And that decision is not something that is possible by your own ability. That decision must be rooted in giving your life to Jesus. So anywhere you are listening to me I am saying that there is a place of repentance towards God and faith towards Christ. That is the first step in following the Lord. There is a place of repentance towards God and faith towards Christ. You are making up your mind. You are saying the world behind me the cross of Jesus before me. I don't want to go where anybody is going. I want to turn away. What are those things that your conscience condemns you for? What are those things you know? What are those sinful things you do? What are those things that are in your life? What are those things that are there? You begin from that point. A repentant. God, I am sorry about this about this, about this, about that. I am turning from that. And more importantly, you are turning to Jesus. Lord Jesus, when you died you died for my sin. You resurrected. It was for my justification. Lord Jesus, I am giving my life to you. I am yielding myself to you. Lord Jesus, into my heart come and stay. Come and reign. Come and be the Lord of my salvation. Come and be the Bishop and the Shepherd of my soul. There is a place of turning away from the world. A place of turning to God. You will see that same pattern you will see that same pattern in someone. Or, you know, the beauty of you know, of following the Lord. The similar pattern you will find it in Psalm 1. Psalm 1, verse 1. It says, Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly nor stand in the way of sinners nor sit in the seat of the scornful. The first thing is a separation from the world. You know, you are making up your mind that you want to come to the Lord. And you are turning in faith towards Jesus Christ. And what I want to make you to know in you know, if you have taken, you know some of you that I am answering this question for might have taken this step. Some of you may not have taken this step. You have not taken this step of being born again. This step of meeting the Lord. This step of giving your life to Christ. That is the first step to take in following the Lord. That is the first command that God gave all men that want to follow him. He said, For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life. So the first thing about the response of God to creation. The first thing about the response of God to man is that God gave his only Son. That anybody who believes in him anybody who puts their faith in Jesus and says, Jesus I put my faith in you for my justification. I put my faith in you. You are my righteousness. I put my faith in you. That is the first command that God gave to every man. That is the first thing. And for those of you who have taken that step and it looks like oh how do I follow the Lord? If that is where you are asking the question from. How do I follow the Lord? You have taken this step now. You have given your life to Christ. You know that you are born again. You can say, I got born again. I have social dates. I got born again social time. I am a believer. I have given my life to Christ. How do I follow the Lord? How do I follow the Lord? How do I follow the Lord? Now, following the Lord for having taken the first step having taken what is the next thing I want to call your attention to? Is a statement that the Lord Jesus made in Matthew chapter 5 Matthew chapter 5 Matthew chapter 5 I want to show you something there Matthew chapter 5 It says I begin from verse from verse 2 I toss them saying Blessed are the purr-in-spiries for theirs is kingdom of heaven Blessed are the purr-in-spiries for theirs is kingdom of heaven when it go to verse He said, Blessed are those I ez who hunger and takes their righteousness For their shall be filled for their shall be filled out of this place for you is the first about this being poor in the spirit um what that scripture is simply saying is that blessed are those who can see how much they need God that's what it means to be poor in spirit blessed are those who realize how much they need God you see one thing you must realize after you have given your life to Christ is that for you to follow the Lord you must have a deep sense of your own poverty I'm not talking of poverty in terms of not having money to spend I'm talking of poverty in terms of your understanding a deep sense of knowing how much you need God you see one thing that helps a man to follow the Lord is the realization that God I need you is the realization you see once you have given your life to Christ you must come to this understanding that I have no power of my own I have no strength of my own I have no no dream of my own I have no plan of my own I have nothing of my own it is nothing all about me Lord God I need you this deep sense of your need for God how do I mean what do I mean you see the Bible shows as many as believed in him to them he gave the power to become children of God you see one thing many times we don't realize is that becoming children of God oh that becoming oh I told you just now about faith towards Christ in your being born again most times we don't realize that everything about following God and is actually a work that has been completed in Jesus everything about the totality of your life everything about your life that's what I'm trying to make you understand I mean everything about your life from start to finish you need to understand that somebody now commands your destiny somebody commands your life from start to finish and that person is Jesus Christ every aspect of your life everything you can become in life you think Christ that's what I mean by understanding your need for God, you must come to this understanding that everything you want to become in life is in Christ the more you can know Jesus the more you can understand Jesus the more you can work with Jesus everything you are thinking about certainly the life will be settled willing to throw the cups at our cash previousrus óg ll f the f life will be answered inside you so you notice that the first thing that the lord when the lord began to teach many people to see is that blessed are the poor in spirit the reason why so many people don't you know become born again and they don't find themselves following god is that they don't come to this sense of spiritual you know this sense of poorness in spirit let me tell you what this thing translates into what is translated into is that you become very deliberate you become very deliberate it is where you understand that without jesus i won't come into jesus without jesus i am finished I am only complete in Jesus Everything about my life is in Jesus It is when you come to that understanding That you will now become deliberate and intentional about your following God What I am trying to make you see Is that one, we give our life to Christ Number two, we realize that we are complete in Christ Number three, we become intentional and deliberate about our following God Let me tell you one thing A very simple thing Somebody says he wants to understand He wants to do very well in mathematics What is the simple thing about doing very well in mathematics? The simple thing about doing very well in mathematics Is that the person begins to give attention to mathematics He begins to become deliberate About following the example Doing the song He begins to pursue it He begins to follow it What I am trying to make you see Is that Yes, I am born again Yes, I have given my life to Christ It goes beyond just I am inside the church It goes beyond I am in a fellowship It goes beyond I am in a department in my fellowship It goes beyond all of that Those things are very very good I will soon come to the power of association Later But one important thing you must get You must get into Is You know Deliberate Understanding that Lord God I want to follow you Come to a decision Come to a decision in your heart Come to a personal You know, being deliberate Being intentional And say, look Lord Jesus I intend to follow you So, what comes next about this intention? I want to show you What comes next about that intention What comes next about that intention Is what I just read In Psalm 1 In Psalm 1 Look at that scripture It says, Beg a good man to go to work in the council of the ungodly To find the way of sinners To see the secret of his comfort Or? But his delight is in the law of the Lord And in his law He meditates day and night Or? You are becoming intentional You are becoming deliberate What are you to be intentional and deliberate about? I'm trying to make you see It's the word of God What are you to be deliberate and intentional about? The word of the Lord The word of the Lord The word of the Lord The Bible says When we separate ourselves from the world In the verse 1 The next thing we need to do in the verse 2 Is that Our delight must now be in the law of God What do we mean by that? What the Bible is trying to say Is that You know Meditating on the word of God Or? Reading the scripture Meditating on the word of God Or? Reading the scripture it, meditating on it and putting it into practice. What did I say? Reading the scriptures. I'm thinking you are becoming very, very intentional. You see, when I look back today, after that time, I did not understand these things. But one thing that God did for me when we look back, when we gave our lives to Christ, we were not privileged to find ourselves in fellowships. Because when we gave our lives to Christ, the church setting then was looking at our experience as very, very strange. So instead of being embraced by the church setting in which we find ourselves, we were rejected. They told us that we are becoming fanatical. We are taking God too seriously. I remember then I was told that, look, this word of God is supposed to be written by the person who wrote it. Why am I being so, why am I being so, you know, so serious? Why am I taking it too serious? Why am I paying too much attention to it? That is what Samaritan has told me when I got born again. But you don't put all your life into it like that. You don't just put all your mind, everything, just, ah, no, it's not like that. You know, we are not too sure if it is the word of God. That was what they were even telling me. Yes, Samaritan has told me that. But I am telling you that the right way to go if you want to follow the Lord is a deletion. The way you set time apart for your academics to learn a skill, the way you set time apart to acquire a skill, eh, to learn something. If it is the same way you need to set time, you are deliberate. You create time. You tell yourself, is it 30 minutes of a day? Is it one hour of a day? Is it two hours of a day? Depending on your situation. You must, you must, you must build an altar. That's what I tell people. Build an altar over your life if you want to follow God. We meet with God at our altar. That's one mistake our generation is making. Young men will tell you that I pray anytime. I read my Bible anytime. I, I, eh, I, yes, I, I, yes, there is a place of praying without ceasing. There is a place, there is a place of studying but anytime I'm in, I'm on transit, maybe in a journey, I just pick my Bible and I'm reading my Bible most of the time all through the journey. Huh? But that is different from a devotion. To be intentional and to be deliberate is to be devotional. It is to be devotional. To be devotional about something is to create a particular time. What I mean is that one thing you must begin to build I will show you that in the life of Abraham. Huh? Look at Genesis chapter 12. Huh? Men will walk with God. You will not see these things in their lives. They come, they come in different shapes but it just will give you an understanding. He says, now the Lord has said to Abraham, please note that statement. The Lord was not just saying, he had said, he had said, he had been told that before. He said, now the Lord has said to Abraham, get out of your country. Huh? So the walk of Abraham with God did not begin in chapter 12. Chapter 12 was only making reference to what the Lord had said. Something that had happened earlier in the life of Abraham. In the life of Abraham. And if you, if, if, if, if you notice, if you notice the, you know, the matter, look at it, look at verse 11. Try, you can get it clearer in chapter 11. The Bible says about terror, it says now, verse, from verse 26. It says now, terror, now, terror lived 17 years and begot Abraham, Nahor and Haram. This is the genealogy of Terah. Terah begot Abram, that is Abraham. Now, an Aram begot Lot, leaving out their background. So the Lot we know with Abram or with Abraham actually came from Aram. So, he says, and Aram died his father, Terah, in his native land, in awe of the Chaldeans. That was how Abraham inherited Lot, because Aram died at a very young age. So, there was nobody to, you know, family members have to take Lot like we normally do today. One uncle, one niece will take the children. Where there is nobody. So, Abraham took Lot. He says, then Abraham and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah. The daughter of Aram, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. But Sarai was barren. She had no child. The Bible now says, and Terah took his son, Abram, and his grandson Lot. The son of Aram, and his daughter Ilosera, and his son Abram's wife. And they went out, and went out with them from all of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. Are you seeing something? A journey has started towards the land of Canaan. And they came to Aram and dwelt there. Somewhere between the land of Or and the land of Canaan. I'm talking about following the Lord. That's what I'm trying to show you. This issue of being devotional. Most young people are not devotional. The basic idea about following God is there must be an altar over your life. And I want to show you. Men, we work with God. You will see this matter of altar. This matter of being devotional. Anything that you are not deliberate about cannot become meaningful in your life. You cannot be casual. Eh? And then be expecting that something great will come out of your following God. No. Intentional or being deliberate is being devotional. It says that they went from there. So they dwelt at Aram. So Aram was between the land of Or and the land of Canaan. So the place of Terah was 205 years until Terah died in Aram. Now when chapter 12 opens. Now the Lord has said to Abraham. The Lord has said to Abraham. Get out of your country. From your family. And from your father's house. To a land that I will show you. And I will make you a great nation. I will bless you. Make your name great. All the blessings. So Abraham departs. As the Lord has spoken to him. And lunch went with him. And Abraham was 25 years old when departed from Aram. Now, Abraham in chapter 12 was responding to something that God had told him. God had told him something while he was in Aram. And so he was responding to that. It was from that Aram that love took a journey with him. He began the journey. Look at what the Bible says. Then Abraham took Terah his wife and lost. And lost his brother's son. And all their possessions that they had gathered. And the people whom they had acquired in Aram. And they departed to go to the land of Canaan. Don't forget that Terah too, the journey from the land of Or was to the land of Canaan. So when they got to Aram. The land that I will show you. Abraham now continued that journey. Which initially from the land of Or to the land of Canaan. Abraham continued to move further. Trying to know where God wanted them to be. So Aram was not the place that they should be. Abraham took the journey again yet further. Because God spoke again. Move on. Now he moved on. So they came to the land of Canaan. Look at what the Bible says. Abraham passed through the land to the place of Shechem. As far as the terebinth tree of Moreh. And the Canaanites were there in the land. He said then the Lord appeared to Hebron. And said to your descendants I will give you this land. Look at what the Bible says. What did the Bible say in that place? He said and there he built an altar to the Lord. Who had appeared to him. He built an altar to the Lord. Look at it again. Verse 8. And he moved from there to the mountain of the east of Bethel. And he pushed his tent with Bethel on the west and I on the east. And there he built an altar to the Lord. And called on the name of the Lord. Are you seeing something about these people? Many times I ask young men. Where is the altar of your life? Where is the altar? Have you become born again? Are you very active in the fellowship? Just since they are good things. There is nothing wrong with them. But if you want to follow the Lord. You must build an altar. What do you mean by building an altar? What I mean is very simple. I am not talking about putting stones and this and that together. Like you build altars in those days. What I am talking about is that you must be deliberate. You must tell Lord Jesus I want to follow you. What are you to do in this following? The Bible says but his delight is in the law of the Lord. And there he meditates day and night. So you build an altar. You become deliberate about the word of the Lord. You become deliberate about scriptures. To read it. To study it. To meditate on it. To obey it. That's what I mean by the altar. Build such an altar over your life. Create a specific time you want to follow God. You want to understand the time. You want to know how things are. Men you follow God. I am showing you what they did. They built altars. They built altars where they call on God. They built altars. They were doing things in their life. Very clear. At a specific time. In your own life. I am going to meet with the Lord. I am alone with God. I say God I have come. And what are you doing? What have you come to do? You have come to meditate. You have come to read. You have come to study. You have come to meditate. You have come to meditate. You have come to look into the word of God. You are seeing the word of God as speaking to you. You are looking at promises. You are looking at instructions. You respond to God in that place in prayer. Is there a promise in the passage that you have read? Is there a command? Is there something to follow? Is there something to correct about your life? You are doing it deliberately. You are taking notes. You are noting it down. You are following. Is there a command? Don't do this. The word of God says this. I will not do this. That is what scripture is saying. Why are we meditating on scripture? You will get the answer in Joshua chapter 1 verse 8. That is a very popular scripture. Look at the reason why we meditate. See how you can understand it. You say this book of the law. Joshua 1 verse 8. This book of the law should not depart from your mind. This book of the law should not depart from your mind. But you should meditate on it day and night that you may observe according to all that is written in it. You see one thing about God is. Sorry, one thing about meditation, reading, studying and meditating. The purpose of it is so that you can observe to do according to what is in the word of God. Any man, to observe something. Would that be drawing their attention? So finish Jaas. is something that can be scientific to serve is to pay attention you are looking at the word of god you are paying attention okay oh this is what the word of god says this is what god wants us to do oh this is a promise for us as believers this is what the lord of god has said oh this and this i am telling you that was how we began to follow god that was how we began when we got what we got born again in the age at the age of 17. we didn't understand so many things but this this was how we started looking for your perfection god that will make you say follow me and i will make you it is god that will make you but one thing god wants you to do build an altar this book of the lord should not depart out of your mouth create time apart god i am creating time apart when you that you are responding to god the journey to god will draw near to you create this time god i'm coming to meet with you and you meet with god meet with god by his word you are deliberately i'm increasing on this so you are going to order to sit in it you are looking at it you are reading it systematically you are looking at systematically book after book chapters after chapter i encourage you begin with the new testament i'm saying that because as a as a young believer, when we began with the Old Testament, we got God. This one, this one, which kind of story is all of this? And then we got this courage as a point. So I encourage you, but later, as we grow up, as we knew the Lord better, honestly, we began to understand great things out of the Old Testament. We began to see that the reality we have in the New Testament, they were foreshadowed in the Old Testament. Sometimes I encourage you to go to the realities first. Because sometimes the Old Testament, they are in shadows. But the reality there in the New Testament, you don't get, they tell you, it's clear. In the Old Testament, some things are clearer. The solutions are clearer. In the Old Testament, God was manifested himself. In the New Testament, God was talking about what is to come. In the New Testament, God was doing what he has said. So it is clearer sometimes in the New Testament than in the Old. So begin with where it is clearer. Begin to study, deliberate, begin to look at the instructions. A promise. Look at what I just told you just now. That's the moment I made a change in my life. At the early point of my conversion, I just saw oh, those who believe in him, or in the book of John, he gave them power to become. I said, wow. So when I believed, I was giving power. Wow. To become. So I have received power. So there is power in my life. There is authority in my life. And as I was wondering, it began to come into my mind. That's okay. So I can begin to understand that I am not powerless. I am not just no. I have power. I can say no to sin. I have received power to become. I can live like a child of God. Now, I have power. I mean, my thinking began to change. Because by encounter, I must tell you is that, do not ask this book of the law, not the partners of your mouth. Make it only day and night. Why are you meditating? What's the purpose of reading the Bible? What's the purpose of studying the Bible? What's the purpose of making it on the Bible? It's for one purpose. So that you can observe to do according to what is written therein. You'll be wondering, what will happen if I begin to observe to do what is... hearing? Eh? The Bible tells you this. What will happen to you? He said, then you will make your way prosperous. And you will have good success. Eh? That's your way. I don't know which way to go in life. I don't know how to go about it. It begins by meditation on scriptures. He said, that will make your way prosperous. I'm telling you. How it happens? If you don't look. If you look. The ways of God. Eh? God moves in a mysterious way. Just begin by observing to do what is in scriptures. And you will see how he directs your ways. Huh? I give you a simple example. Was there a voice that told Joseph, don't sleep with Potiphar's wife. The Joseph that we studied last month. Was there any voice? Son of man, son of man, don't sleep with Potiphar's wife. If you sleep with Potiphar's wife, you are not going to enter into my plan for your life. Don't sleep with her. So that she can throw you into prison. And from there, you become the prime minister of Egypt. That is my plan for your life. Was there a voice? There was no voice. You are simply responding to scripture. I will like. Look. This man is. This woman is your wife. I do not convert. wife no god don't want me to do this i found that inside scripture and the woman tried to fuck the boy said no i'm not going to do this thing god don't want me to do it and eventually the boy found himself in prison but he also found himself to become the prime minister of egypt and he entered into god's purpose for his life why by responding to scriptures i'm telling you the first thing is not about looking for a voice don't begin to look for one voice son of man famine is coming to nigeria next year therefore begin to plant tomatoes don't begin to look for that kind of thing that is not your starting point i'm not saying that god that god does not speak mystically to us i can tell you one thousand and one times how god has spoken to me but i'm going to be going to talk about basic principles by working with god if you begin to rely your life on mythical revelation you may miss god because something about revelation is that there must be some sense of scriptures there are several revelations today as i've seen i've seen people who said that they have this living that if they don't sleep with their wife with the one the lady they want to marry as wife the parents of the lady will not give you to will not give them the only way to make sure that the parents give them is by sleeping that is leaving the heart in their spirit i said they committed fornication and when the young man was telling me that i said young man i said no you are not correct your way please the lord will make your enemy to be at peace with him it's not by fornication that you make your man to give to give to give him your daughter but the young man was telling me that the other people said there are other elders we told you that that is the way to go that is that the lady's father is very stubborn and he said when they confirmed his revelation he now did that that is not a revelation from god so the first thing about following god young man young woman listen to me the way god talks us is that this book of the law should not depart from your mouth become deliberate and intentional i remember stepping back as a young man i don't know how to all of this how they happen they were just for the art of god's mercy i can tell me product of this message because nobody was giving us encouragement nobody was even telling us what to do it was later when i was looking back that i began to understand a lot of these things that god took me through look you have become fanatical you have become fanatical no no we don't want this in the church why should we be speaking in tongues when there's nothing like god this holy spirit see no no no no you are bringing confusion and so we were just thrown into the dark but somehow there was a desire to there was a desire to follow god and begin to struggle the word of god it was not the time to realize that it was just the holy spirit helping us to get it right think back that sometimes we find ourselves 13 hours 14 hours of a day we are meditating on scriptures we are just staying with scriptures meditating meditating meditating look into the word of god what does he say what is the word ah okay the word of god says it oh look at this promise for my life oh we noted it down oh look oh so we should not keep my list oh i will not be keeping my list again so we should not do this we are just doing nothing we are just following it we didn't know that as we go along there's still going to be greater light they're going to be mystical voice they're going to be vision they're going to be trance they are going to be dreams they are going to be god speaking directly into our ears we are going to have encounters with angels i've had encounter with angels speaking to me telling me to do things but that was not my starting point the starting point is you must is the place where you meet with god it's your residential address i would like to just use that very in a very simple way you know if you want to give somebody and you say where do we meet do you understand me now where do we meet okay either i live here or this place is my office they will not take it to that place what i'm going to say is that it will begin to create a deliberate time to meditate on scriptures to read scriptures to respond to god in prayers and according to the word of god that you are reading you find promises there you say god i take this promise for my life you find yourself today lord set me to do this you find command yet lord help me to follow this command that becomes you respond to god by prayer you pray those words you respond to god because prayer is useless it's not according to the word of god he says he says if you if you dwell in me and my word abides in you you shall ask us however you will so prayer must be born out of the word of god as you respond to god that way and you are doing that you are doing that you will be surprised what will be happening life you'll be making your way prosper that is the beginning of making your way prosperous that's the beginning of following god that is what yes that's how you follow god the foundation of following god is responding to god by scriptures what does it mean to walk in the spirit that is what it means yes people have asked me that question that will say walk in the spirit not with the love of the flesh what does this mean basically and fundamentally speaking to walk in spirit is to obey the word of God walking in the spirit that is contained in the scripture is not a walk in the spirit it's just spiritism you are not being spiritual you are just practicing spiritism the difference between being spiritual and practicing spiritism which is the word of demonology but to be spiritual is to obey scriptures but you cannot obey what you don't know you cannot respond to what you have not discovered you cannot respond to what you have not found you cannot respond you cannot know the truth the word of God is the truth so if you know the truth you set you free set you free from so many things you begin to build that altar you say that will make your faith better and then you will have good success look at something again the scriptures look at psalm 19 psalm 19 following the lord following the lord psalm 19 i read from verse 1 he said the heavens declare the glory of God and women show and human men show his handwork day unto day utter speech and night unto night with this knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line has gone out through all the earth and there was to the end of the to the end of the world in them he has set a tabernacle for the sun which is a bridegroom coming out of his chamber without a bridegroom coming out of his chamber out of the chamber and just is like a strong man that's wrong his ways his rising is from one end to the other end and his circles to the other end and there's nothing hidden from his each uh look at what you look at what the scriptures now says i haven't talked about the the the how you know talking about this song and it goes wrong how nothing escapes it i'm saying because if you look if you look at some psalm 84 letter it says our god is like the sun our god is like the sun uh now i will talk about the capacity of the sun i will later the capacity what the sun can do and how nothing can escape the sun i will make reference to the you know god in creation and what god did in creation and how some things that god did how they work and how they operate he now came to the word of god don't forget that the word of god is god himself everything was created by this word of god and what did he say about the law of god the law of god is perfect what is the law what is he doing converting the soul you want a conversion in your soul huh you want a conversion in your soul you want to be free from so many things you want to be out of some things you want to be out of some things that your soul has become a slave to do you want to be free you want to experience freedom in your emotions you are not a slave of lust you're not a slave of anger you're not a slave of bitterness you are not a slave of hatred you're not a slave to inordinate affection you want a conversion in your soul look at what the bible says the law of the lord is power the law of the lord is power is perfect what is he doing converting the soul i'm talking about following the lord i'm showing you where where are these things how they build you meditate on the law of god as you push them into practice as you subject your thinking to them as you subject your mind to them what happens to your soul it experiences conversion look at the next thing the testimony of the lord is true what do you find here making wise the simple do you want to be wise and it is as you read the testimony of god in his law go and look at his testimony what god said about himself what god said about himself like i just told you something about god this morning that it is his delight that you seek him while you are young that is his testimony for you to be wise you are not a slave of lust you are not a slave of anger you must know what god the testimony of god what did god say about himself there are many people today who don't know what jesus gave them at calvary because they don't know what jesus said they don't give themselves to the scriptures to know what we are giving what are the promises what are the privileges what did he do for us by his death what's wrong making wise is simple do you want to be wise this is the testimony of the lord the status of the lord that right rejoice in the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes you want to understand the time you want to understand the situation you want to begin to know how to respond you want your eyes to be open you want your eyes to be enlightened this is in the lord of the lord he says the fear of the lord is clean and judging forever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous all together more to be desired are they than gold yea than fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb moreover by then your servant is warned you want to be warned you want to be questioned you want to be you want to be prepared this is by them and in keeping them there is great reward in keeping them there is great reward there is great reward so what am i saying about following god how the first thing i said is that you must be born again repent and give your life to jesus the second thing i said how is that you must understand uh that's your best i won't give you your life to jesus the best that you can ever become is in jesus and that except you really know him you can never become all you ought to become for anybody to have the kingdom of god you must have this kind of art jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit for death is the kingdom of god anybody that is not poor in spirit cannot have god's kingdom that's the second thing i told you poor in spirit to have the kingdom of god you must be poor in spirit you must understand that you need him the the third thing that i mentioned to you in following the law is what i'm amplifying and i said build altars it is building this altar damage you know that i'm elaborating on building altar how do you build your altar you build altars by being devotional that's the thing the first thing i said about building all that you become devotional if you're not a devotional person then it means you are not deliberate and intentional to be intentional and deliberate to be devotional now devotional what are you doing in the devotion is what i must do in answer to in the devotion what you are doing is that the law of the lord is your delight what do we mean by that you are meditating on each day and night because you have made up your mind to do according to all that is in it you have made up your mind that i want to do what is in the word of god that is you know talking about building water okay you make up your mind to do what is there and we make up everything what is there uh i said you make a process you will have good sources and why i'm not i'm not showing you why is the word of god like this why is it that you do this with the word of god uh it's what i'm showing you because god has said some things about his word and we cannot separate ourselves from it now how do you go about this meditation i mentioned that when i was talking about you must be systematic about your bible reading what you might be systematic about your bible reading huh if you take a test book huh you don't go you you don't really You don't look at chapter 1, you look at page 1 in chapter 1, you jump again to chapter 20, you look at page 4 in chapter 20, you come back again to chapter 1, to look at page 2 in it, no, don't do it that way. Don't do it that way. Be systematic. It will be more helpful. And for some people, some people said that, can we use devotional? Of course, if you choose to use devotional, it's okay. If you are comfortable with it, it's okay. But I'm not talking about how to read the Bible. Be systematic. Take it book after book. And I just encourage that if you are just starting this thing, begin with the New Testament. Go and begin with the Gospel. Go and know what Jesus did in his lifetime. What he said. What God did. From there, go to the epistles. Go and look at what the apostles said about him. What they said in their preaching. Or, take them book by book. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts of the Apostles, Romans, 1 Corinthians. Go like that, book after book. Note in what they said. Be deliberate. Make sure you are observing. What God is saying. Is there a command for me here? Is there something to correct my life about? Is there an example to follow? Is there a promise to claim? You are noting it down. And when you are true with this particular time, you respond to this, do this devotionally. You do it consistently. That is what it means to build altars. To begin to build altars. Start like that in your life. You will begin to experience that God will begin to meet you at your altar. That is the truth. God will begin to meet you at your altar. You will be seeing God meeting you at your altar. You will be seeing God, you will be experiencing God at the point of your altar. That is a very very you know,'this very very fundamental things. And why, Why am I emphasizing this word about? altar is because your altar, your altar is the beginning of true revelation. At the same time also, it is the climax of all revelations. Mark my word. Your altar is the beginning of true revelations. Your altar is the climax of all revelations. What I mean by that is that the word of God is our lamp and our light. There should be no vision. There should be no revelation. There should be no voice. There should be nothing that makes us contradict the laws of the Lord. When the Spirit leads us, as long as we are led by the Spirit, we are the sons of God. The Spirit leads us. Now, in line with scriptures, because the Spirit of revelation, the Spirit of prophecy, these four things come together. The Spirit of the scripture, don't forget that all scriptures are written by, you know, as the Holy Spirit inspires men. Don't forget that. So, the Spirit of the scripture, there is a spirit behind scripture. Not just the letter. But the Spirit of the scriptures. The letter is just Bible study. The Spirit of the scripture is encountering God of the Bible. And all I've been talking about is how you can encounter the God of the Bible, not just the Bible. The kind of acts that meet with God. The kind of decisions that make us to meet with God. Now, the Spirit of the scripture, that Spirit of the scripture is the Spirit of revelation. It is the Spirit of prayer. And also the Spirit of prophecy. In other words, the Spirit of scripture, the Spirit of prophecy, the Spirit of revelation, the Spirit of prayer, the Spirit of truth, and the Holy Spirit is all one. Spirit of revelation, the Spirit of prophecy, the Spirit of prayer, the Spirit of scripture, are all one. The Holy Spirit, we are talking about all but one person. All but one person. That is why they tie together as one. And that is why you will notice. Oh, I am emphasizing these fundamental things very very well to you. Look at the temptation of Jesus Christ. The victory at the temptation was on the basis of the scripture. Turn this stone to bread, it is written. Man shall not live man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of the presence of the mouth of the Lord that is Ptolemy chapter 8 verse 3 that spirit of the Christ is the spirit of scripture oh I fail to mention that that the spirit of the Christ is the spirit of the scripture so that nothing, don't let anybody deceive you by bringing some fables according to a sound doctrine oh all of these things I will give you if you bother to worship me it is written you must not tell the Lord your God then God alone you should worship and him alone you should serve look at the temptation again of jump down he will give his anger and strife over you eh you know the spirit of scripture, the spirit of Christ exposes again even in that you must not tell the Lord so so that there's a way you can't even know scriptures eh you know that is not correct if you don't give yourself to it you see the devil gives the scripture again and again Jesus you see that in all of those things it was scripture I show you Jesus Christ again the birth of Jesus was according to scriptures Jesus being taken to Egypt and being brought back again to um Judea was according to scripture out of Egypt I will call out to you I will ask my son ah Jesus ah preaching the first time Jesus came out to preach in the temple the Bible says he told them that today this scripture is fulfilled before you what was the scripture eh you put the light upon me but you are not asking me to preach the gospel to the poor eh when Jesus was to put in that scripture eh he said this day this scripture is fulfilled before you before you what I meant to make you see that Christ is the fulfillment of scripture do you see him again at another point eh when he was to be taken out at the after the betrayal you know doing the betrayal of Judas eh he said now your time has come up out of darkness eh and when they wanted him to resist what did he say he said how then will the scripture be fulfilled that it must be so for now and when they wanted him to resist what did he say he said how then will the scripture be fulfilled that it must be so for now he said that the Christ was limited was molded by scripture so what am I trying to say today how do I follow God fundamental thing I am telling you today eh are these basic things I am saying eh take take your time to be sure that you are born again take your time eh to be intentional eh take your time to be sure that you are born again take your time eh to be intentional eh to be intentional to be intentional if you are born again take your time to understand who exactly you are or if you are not poor in spirit you cannot find the Lord anybody who is proud in spirit will not find the Lord eh the rich he will send empty away eh but the poor eh he will give the kingdom you must understand that if you feel you know how to manage your life you know what to do you know how to do it you feel you know where I am going you know you are full of your own ways you will not find God but when you have this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this What are you to do At your personal level What are the things to address Basically at your personal level And as the Lord Gave us grace We will climb again on some other ladders We need to look at again In following the Lord But this basic That I have discussed with you They cannot be compromised If this Biggie is not there The other things We want to start talking about We will not be able to get them right This is the first thing to get right The first thing to get right Is Every vine Every branch Must be connected to the vine Every branch Must be connected to the vine There is just one Lord And one God And one God And one God And one God And one God Nobody Nobody Must think that He can build anybody Or he can build on anybody Who is not personally connected to his vine The first thing about your life You as an individual You must be personally connected to the vine Before other things Can take their place You must have A personal connection to the vine Any branch To the vine To the vine To the vine That is not connected to the vine Will dry off No matter what you are doing with that vine That branch No matter how you try to decorate it No matter how you try to do it No matter how you try to turn it No matter how you try to put it No Nothing goes on The first thing is this Connection to the Lord Personally first connect yourself To the Lord Technically I don't know whether we have any questions That we need to respond to Okay Okay I'm told that there is no question online That we need to respond to So let's begin to talk to the Lord in prayer this afternoon Let's begin to talk to the Lord in prayer We need to respond to the Lord in prayer How do I follow the Lord?

God greatly desires a godly home for them. These are words of restoration and instruction in righteousness from Family Tech Ministry. May ye be blessed as you listen. The point I am making is that the word of God is clear about what should be the relationship between husbands and their wives. It's too clear. What should be the relationship between those who are not yet married. The relationship between brothers and sisters. Between brothers and sisters, the word of God, the truth is, it says, And Paul said to Timothy, He said, younger women, handled as what? Sisters, with all purity. Where is purity today in the midst of young people? Where is purity? That's why I gave the example of the case of someone who had a relationship within the space of Christmas. He has repregnated his sister. If you have chance here, he said he proposed a lot of that, everything. Then the number of the case will go amidst the attack. It's too clear. He said, go and meet your parents. Go and meet your parents. But the point I am making is that these are brothers in fellowship. Sisters in fellowship. Where is purity? When they are trying to manage the same thing, the word of God is clear. Osborne, love your wife. As Christ, the direction is clear. Love the church. There are several ways you can love a wife. But none of them meet the standard of God. Apart from as Christ. And the reason between Christ and the church is very clear. Christ did not die for a holy church. He did not die for a righteous church. He did not die for an obedient church. Christ died for us. We were sinners. So the old man is loving the wife unto death. Not because the wife is holy, the wife is obedient, the wife is submissive. Rather, it is by loving her that the wife will become dusted. But men will say, no. Because he did not submit, I will not love. Because he did not do this, I will not love. Forgetting that, it is not the woman that is asking death to love her. It is the command of the Lord. So when they don't love her, it is disregarding the Lord. You also find our sister, the same thing. Why are you not submitting to him? You need to know my husband. You need to know him. Somebody who cannot even display love, you tell me to submit to him. I will show him in this house. That seems to be what we enjoy. But we forgot that. That was the life we were living before we met with Jesus. And our submission two weeks ago is that, look. Our submission two weeks ago is that, look. Jesus came into our life to give us hope. That's why he came. When he came and he said, no, live like this. When he prepared the way of life for us to live. Because the way of life that should give us what? Hope. But we keep turning against that. We keep turning against that hope. He gave us hope. In other situations, we will be what? We will be hopeless. And today, what am I going to make our marriages? Eh? Hopeless marriages. You see hopelessness all around. That woman is job. You enter into the churches. But then this brother will talk. That sister will talk. You will see hopelessness. You will see Christian youth not having difference from unbelieving youth. The way brothers, the way boys are dealing with girls. But they are telling you to do. Today he is doing fiancée, fiancée. Today he is actually befriending Sister Funke. The other one is doing Sister Funke. I said there, he broke my heart. And then we go and propose again to Sister Fosse. You don't know what they do in the world. And then we say we are brother. Say we are sister. I was in Lagos. One of the presidents of the fellowship. Eh? Was proposed to two sisters at the same time. President of fellowship. Making a difference. So, you see, among our youth today. And among the married. What do you find? Hopelessness. You don't find marriages that reflect the glory of God in the image of God. That's why I said that. That's why I said that. Hope for one. The hope for this generation. I keep telling people. The hope. If we want our marriages to have hope. If we want our lives to have hope. We must return back to what the Lord said. That lifestyle that He gave us. The Lord came. And the way we say. Christ is us. The what? The hope of glory. Once we remove Christ from our lives. Any other life that we are living outside Christ. It's all blessedness. That is why it's so, it's all so common today. See I have one. I was counseling eh, you know, the founder of a church somewhere. And eh, she, let me leave the domination now. It's a personal, it's a personal issue that we deal with people. And I have a friend. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. He is a pastor. Let me tell you. That woman is a witch. Talking about it is are you follow? Me to prosper financially And she is not prospering. It's what? You call that, you call that, you call that a woman of God. A woman of the devil. Discarding is wise. At times we make those three, four five sentences. you know what i said i said sir i think i know i think i think i know what you've been wishing your ministry and i opened the scripture i just took him to the scripture i said sir the bible says a man ought not to cover his head because he is the image and the glory of god but a woman is the glory of the man that is why men don't cover her women cover there's a token of this conference which is this car but if the master is the young weather's car for no scar is deeper than that this car is just a token so we can tell our children ah what is why are you putting stuff to be able to tell them the reason it's just a sign that we can ask you to tell our children and teach them the truth about the difference between a man and a woman they are not equal the one is not inferior to the other that is the mistake we are making that's what i'm going into today that's why someone wants to oppress the other ones they are not equal but it's not about inferiority and superiority it's about purpose for example will you say your belief is inferior to your sheep one is not 200 naira the other one is 2005 but is it inferiority and superiority what is the difference it's purpose what you use this shoe for you don't want to use the sleeper it's tough but the mentality most men are having is about one is superior one is inferior and that is the that is the that is the undoing of most men but that's what i'm going into gradually but i'm trying to you know what i i'm trying to show the man woman is the glory of the man i said because the man is not of the woman the woman is of the man the man was personally that we were taking out of the man so the one extension of the man it made them feel me but the male the female was made from the name so the woman is of the man the man is not from the woman the woman is from the man however the man is by the woman there's something there every time you suppress your mind suppress your glory. The man is the human and the glory of God. The woman is the glory of the man. I said, sir, the reason why your glory cannot shine is that every day you suppress your glory, you curse your glory, you verbally assault your glory, you march down your glory, and you on the mountain pray. That woman is the OGO that you are looking for. I'm not talking back to Ephesians where it says, he that loves his wife. He that loves his wife loves himself. He that curses his wife could have done the same thing. Because this is why! Because this is why! Because this is why! What am I to bring out? Is that we forgot that we were hopeless when Christ came into our life to give us a new life to live. That life is to give us hope. But the more we are throwing away this life the more we are making our marriages our land you know, hopeless. Young men want to be in forefront of. That's to ask for God. Actually it is the devil side. The devil push me and I pray to God their boldness to stand for God, their courage their courage to stand for God their boldness to stand in faith of prayer has been robbed cut down by what? By lust. That was the background that was the background and I was just praying you know and I was giving out the presentation I was giving out the presentation you know how God showed me a revelation and that was the revelation People want to fill a drum with the water of life and a soup basket they will go to the sea they will fall into the drum and they were sweating trying to fill the drum and they were trying to fetch the water with basket and they were doing it and they were sweating and they were doing that Why has God is offering their life through him the cross? And God said that to the church Men and women with their marriages try to, try to obtain life by going to the river in a river to fetch to fill the drum of their life with basket they are sweating they are struggling they are doing everything they have come of age all of that you think you can go to the side of yourself honestly you think it's a perfect situation and we trust God we trust God that the patient will come the diver will come people will understand what the earth will do and the earth will come around the day after we will come with this with this name that's the Genesis Chapter 2 and chapter 3 Genesis chapter 3 Genesis chapter 4 let us make man chapter 1 chapter 26 God said let us make man in our own image in our own likeness He burns in the sky over the light source and all the wild animals and all the creatures that move along the ground. So God created man in his own image and the image of God created him in male and female in his own image. That's Genesis 1 verse 22 to 27. Now, turn your Bible to Genesis chapter 2. Look again in chapter 2 from verse 7. Notice how the man was, how that creation was done. This chapter 1 was the summary of creation. God gave you the whole summary. Chapter 2 is going to tell us how it was done. God said, let us look at one image. That's our own nightmare. And God made them men and women. He said, I think God did make the creation at once. He said, make man. Man has been working. Later, he now made the woman. But everything happened on the sixth day. Not the sixth day but the seventh day. That's a new image. Women were made on the sixth day. Man was made and woman was made later the sixth day. The sixth day, one man was to be created. That's seven. Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground. And took him from him, took all his clothes to the dress of life. And the man became a living being. Now the Lord has planted a garden in the east, in Egypt. And there he put the man he had formed. Tell us how it was done now. The Lord made all kinds of trees to grow out of the ground. Do you know of all those trees? I believe you are familiar with these trees. Let us go in on. So, verse sixteen. And the Lord commanded the man, You are free to eat from every tree in the garden. But you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. For when you eat it, you will certainly die. Note, at a distance, the female of the male has not been made. But we know that because God was made on the sixth day, that's why the Bible says, He that made them at the beginning made them male and female. But it was not at the same time. I am going to explain something about this matter of the creation. I am going to lead you into a very significant part of this issue. I am going to tell you that God is working man and beast today. And He is telling you, masculinity and femininity. Do you know what is the essence of the feminist movement today? Femininity. You know, the men and women, they are equal. Do you know what I am saying? I cannot lead down to a man. Do you know what is very significant about leading down? It's a culture. They don't lead down to you. So, what is the culture of that thing? How do you know that? It's a culture. Hello, call my name. And it is not the same thing. So, that culture that we are leading down here, what I am saying is that, this is the culture that we are leading down. And the culture that we grew up with that culture says, you know what, I cannot lead down. Me and the man, we are equal. That is where the problem is. It's not about the leading down. I hope you are getting the point I am making. Because leading down is just culture. It's about the leading down. The matter is, in the mindset, God will say we are transformed by the renewing of our mind. God will work seriously, perfectly, the man. Is that not? And that is it. That making is very, very crucial. If you want to know why it is crucial, read Timothy. 1 Timothy chapter 2, verse... Somebody read that for us. 1 Timothy 3 and 11. 1 Timothy 3 and 11. 1 Timothy 3 and 11. Read there. 1 Timothy 3 and 11. Women should learn and balance... Who is speaking here? Huh? What was he speaking to Moses? He was telling to Moses, how people want to conduct themselves in the church. Huh? Where do we get that? That's what he was speaking in. But where do we get that? It's around... 3... Where he said, in the case I delay. Please, somebody get that for me, please. 3.15. Please read that 3.15. No, before that. Or do I have to come to you soon? I'm writing this instruction. Say that, if I am delayed. If I am delayed... Do we know how people want to conduct themselves in the church? What is the Church of the Living God? The pillar and the foundation. Even though we are countries away, we are the pillar and the foundation of the living God. The pillar and the foundation... truth away. You are the pillar of the foundation of truth. You are the foundation of truth. You answer our question. Okay. No. You can get why Paul was writing that letter ahead. Oh, forget me. In an answer back to the chapter 2 that we are reading. Read well now. 2.11. Let the women learn in silence. With all suggestion. With all suggestion or with all immunity. A heritance. But I suffer not a woman to teach. Not to assert authority over the man. But to be in silence. But to be in silence. For Adam was first come. For Adam was first come. It is not because there was sin. It is not sin. Sin have not entered. Sin have not entered. Sin came because of sin. That is why a woman shall be known. Sin shall be given as redeemed from sin. It is not a matter of sin. It is a matter of creation. It is not a matter of stupor. The reason that this is coming. It is not because a woman sinned. It is because Adam was first come. If there was to be no sin, If there was to be no sin, Eh? The man and woman were never equal. Even if there was no sin. Even if there was no sin, Adam was first come. By creation. By the order of creation. By the commandment of creation. the Bible says, for the head of God, for the head of Christ is God, the head of the man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man. So that when the woman takes an aspect outside the man, otherwise the woman is going to take an aspect outside Christ and outside God. That is why he says, um, although this is a great mystery, I believe about Christ and the church, nevertheless let every man love his own wife and let every woman see that she's from me to her husband. Even though we are not yet perfect, even though we are not yet become Christ, even though the brother may have some things that may not be like that of Jesus, even though they say some of these things that is not complete cognition, that the church is committed to Christ, the brother is not to know that they are both working together. God is perfect with them. He is to me not to know that they are imperfections, forgive them self, but he must always remember that no matter what the church has done, I must love her as Christ loved the church, and no matter what the brother does, I must promise to him the way the church promised to Christ. If that thing is not in order, creation has been disorganized. It's not sin. It is not without sin. I don't want you to realize as you go and you will see, that it was not without sin. It was Adam's sin that God said it's not good for him to be alone. There was no sin. So man, even in the fullness of his glory, he sinned at this place beside the woman. Even when he had no sin. So it's not because the man has sinned, so the woman has come to God. No, you know, even if there is no sin, glory full of glory, one with God, no mistake, no other word as creation now... that, he just called the woman, he just called the woman and said she was speaking and it was God that was speaking. He was speaking and God was speaking. It was at that time that God said He's not going to be by it. So you don't think that because man sinned, you know man nothing, you're now did what? No, no, no. Even if a man is working one on one with God, he and God, they have life, they are thinking. One man of God will go through. When he enters the ministry, he and God will sit in council. So what are you talking about? We are in a time of madness today. Even if a man is in ministry with God, as long as God has not given him services, it is not good for him to be in ministry. So it is not a matter of sin. There is no sin in this world that we are discussing. It is of creation. Because for Adam was first son. Before you now go to the next religion, there will be going to be very few. What is the next religion now? Adam was first son before you. And Adam was the second. That is not the second religion. It was in the first religion. How can you and the Bible be together? You can still go home and reflect on these things. You are all Bible students. You can still go home and reflect on these things. You are all Bible students. Reflect and ask God to open your own eyes to this matter. I was reading a commentary. And I disagree with the commentary. Something about the woman's subjection. The woman's subjection to the man. And the man's subjection to the woman. And I just... it is a big deal. I read a commentary written by one of the early fathers. I just factored in and I did like this counting. It is not because the woman sinned. That was actually the subjection. That was the second religion. There was a first religion. It was because Adam was first son. And so, Adam is the thing. Adam is the thing that carries the divine mandate. And that was why when the woman sinned, there was no immediate consequence. Until the man... When the woman ate the fruit, there was no consequence. Her eyes were see-through. Because when the man ate the fruit, her own eyes were open. So she became a sinner by the man. Even though she ate the fruit, it was as by one man that sin entered the world. Not as by one woman. Because she does not carry the mandate. It is the man that carries the mandate. But this is not superiority and inferiority. Because in the fullness of his glory, he cannot survive alone. Except in his fullness with the woman. That is what he is talking about. He is talking about what? He is talking about what? Now, before he came with, the woman was deceived. Then, and would be deceived, you know, issue to another way. But she would be set in work. Who is he talking about? But the woman who was deceived was in conversion. Not in standing. She shall be saved and shall be healed. She shall be saved and shall be healed. If she does what? If they continue in faith and charity and holiness. If they continue in faith and charity and holiness, they will not die in the grave. It will not happen. If they continue like that, God will take you to straight death. Because that was what happened to her. He said, I will multiply thy sorrow in confession. When the woman came to him, the God, let us pray. The God made me like the Hebrew woman. The God made me like the Hebrew woman. You know that is not in the Bible. You have been in the mission of God that they have raised you from the grave. Ma, I was in God's meeting. God did not pray upon me. That God would make God like the Hebrew woman who were praying and praying when they are giving back. That sin is a curse. And God has cast us free just from that curse. That was such a great thing. I was... I was... I was... I was.. I was... I was... I was... I was... I was... I was... I said to the woman, God has set me free. What to pray for that? The Egyptian midwife, Bifra and the other person Because God granted them favor, granted the Hebrew woman favor before death They did not kill the male child, they scared them When they now go to Pharaoh, they now lie Pharaoh, you can go and say these things are good things, they are all in truth Because people don't pay attention to Bible You don't do things on some famous spiritual things But I call them spiritual ignorance Because it's just, there is no truth in these things The word of God is truth The Egyptian midwife, they don't lie, they lie Pharaoh, the Hebrew women, they are not like the Egyptian That before they get here, they are giving back And they are already with their child They are going to say, so God bless those women Because they protected So, the truth was that, that was not the situation The only lie I hope you understand the point I am making What is in the scripture is that even though they will be paid So that, some people begin to feel that because they keep paying in concessions, they are not godly There is nothing like that If you keep paying, it does not mean that they are not godly They keep paying now, they are not like the Hebrew women God is not good And they are not going to keep paying They are going to keep paying to free them Because they are not spiritual That's why they keep paying in concessions It's not true You don't keep on giving things to people That is not biblical What God promised is that you may still pay But lose and you will still go through it That is what is the Bible That is the Bible Now, what does God say? You will get to that point You will get to that point I am going to show you something So the man was made The man was given command That he should take care of his daddy And then he will do something and he will die When it got to 18 Which I have already explained When it got to 18 What did the Bible say here? That is when God now said It is not good for the man to be alone Am I correct? 18 So it is not good that the man should be alone I will make I will make a helper To do something So You notice that You notice You notice something Very clear from there Which I have explained earlier That The resurrection of the woman Was not because the man sinned So if there was no sin If Adam If the woman was not deceived And everything went well Eh? There was a way that was designed The way that was designed That the man was such a So he started demanding The man The man is the image and the glory of God The woman is the image and the The woman is the glory of the man If you want to put it in another way God had a need A man was created Man had a need A woman was created But all of this Is in the purposes of God That is why people Women don't align at best Want to get married They don't want to align at best with this purpose At the end of her life God says that you cannot count our words For being supported You find that in 1 Timothy chapter 5 You say do not take into the list Eh? A widow Eh? That is below the age of 60 Or No You know people can't be conditioned To take into them Why? That is because They are inseparable Eh? ens abide na Eh? Yes Eh? Eh? Yes He will take to Your heart Just the same Or More Busy Eh? I do not see Ugh And then Something He will take 영상 When He look different Eh? He He then He He will take Humor When a man says, say true to his wife, so if he is married twice, it's not a good spiritual material. They divorce, it's not a good spiritual material. They are done against the order of God. Except to sit down and study and look very well and understand the basis of some of these things. A man does not say, my wife look, I don't like this woman, this woman is naughty, this woman is dirty, this woman is... and they throw her away and they pick another one. Or the one says, the woman is not suitable for the purpose of God for my life. And says, leave that one and marry another one. It's not peace. It's not a good spiritual material. For a man to be a good spiritual material, if he marries a woman, the inseparability in the woman. Just like the woman needs to talk like a game. How many times do you wish in a game, sir? And you become a contagious person and go and take the next game. Can you count how many times you seek? How many times do you just wait for me to take? He says, okay, I don't divorce you, stay away. He never needs to make intercession for us. We want to see a man that is like kind. And when we don't see him like that, it's not a good spiritual material. Why? A man who cannot manage young women, he has paid in one family, there to care. If you now put that man, what do you call church? It's not because we are blind. It's not because that is not the guardian of many families. So a man who prays is not faithful. He is not faithful to ovality. He cannot be faithful that much. That's the spiritual principle. If you cannot manage one family, you now ask that young man to have so many families. What's up? Is that the law of God? That's not the law of God. We are so disclaimed from so many things. Our lacrosse, Jerry, our land, we are just turning, we are turning this. We are, you know, common sense, philosophy. We turn this and turn this. It's not to say to him that, it's not to say, it's not to say, you know, to the sinful. The other piece of God is plain. Common sense is not plain. It's because we don't want to endure truth. Our heart is hard. We are difficult to choose. Like our poor father that perished in the wilderness. And that is why many people are perishing today in their marriages. Marriage is not making people. It's punishing them. It's wasting them. They put them in marriage and because they marry, you see, spiritual life is scattered. The sister you see and the son you saw is very bad. I don't want this. I wish I did. I wish I did. Don't marry. Marriage is supposed to make people. You see, people grow. Grow. From nothing. You see, people grow. Grow. Grow. Grow. Grow. And become mighty trees. Because two are better than one. But today it happens one is better than two. We are not three. Today it's another. I am telling you. I am telling you. I am telling you with God. I am telling you so here. The relationship that we create on the other has been set. Even if there was no sin. Even if there was no sin, the other has been set. And that is why God wants that we sustain. I tell people, when I used to teach my son some touching that will go out the other hand. He say, Papa Oli, say something about this child. Say something particularly about this child. I said, Papa Oli, read the Bible. Every time God starts touching something that is particular for you, I am telling you. Every time God starts touching something that is so specific. I am telling you this. I am telling you this. Something that is particular to him is creation. He needs a sign and a symbol so that we can tell to our children. Why did God ordain the Sabbath? Because he rested on the seventh day. And today we are keeping the Sabbath. We know because in times of day, I hope you know, although some people by day, some of you have done so. They will know, Jesus said, some of you don't know Jesus' label. He said, I am the Sabbath. Everybody has welcomed me to Jesus. They have welcomed me to that Sabbath and I will give you rest. That rest that Jesus gives, every person of God will have that. Like he said in the Old Testament. He said, I am the Lord of the Sabbath. Sabbath, what does it mean to the man? Just to cut him off. Every person of God will have the Sabbath of God, to enter into Christ's rest, to be cut off from God. So the Sabbath will remain. He will do things like that. Every time God will do things like that, he will say, He will call you twice, twice every day, okay? You are making fun of me so that you will tell your children, you will not take me. That is the essence of this car. The essence of this particular car. Just to say a certain thing that whatever I say, I wish only me and my wife would not be putting this car on our head. Adam was first born before you. You can explain, there is something in that thing that is so crucial. Because once we recognize that, the man will not understand that there is something about it. That he has been created, he has been made, he has been designed. That this man is first today. It is not about the woman, it is about the man. The man was first born. Even if you see the episode, what kind of creation was it in? Every time the man is created, it is about the man. It is not about the woman. I am not saying the woman will not be the first to see. The woman will say, hey, God has created you in my life. She may be the first to see. But it is about the man. It is about the man. We must make our sons and our daughters understand this thing. That it is about you. A man is not a human. A man is not a part of a human. A human cannot be happy. I will break this house. I will cut down this house. This man is the man once again. As long as the man is healthy, that is my value. That is my value also. My dear, you should know my belief. But you know a man says, I don't want this marriage. God says, wahala. Because sin enters. Sin has no source of cause. You are the man. Enter into it. It becomes a matter. You are the person who will lead our faith tomorrow. You know that a man is not a person that crosses the flag. It is not the man. God is not a man. Enter into it. Do you think God crosses the flag when he was here? He was here to protect you. He saved you. He revived you. He was made your Messiah . For the great God. For the great God. For the Great God who is all He says to do what? You look at this. Nobody works at that place. What has happened? You have been sold and given all, to God. Somebody came and said, you are carrying something? I said, yes. I said, yes. They said, sorry. Are you not a madman? Meanwhile, community is being suppressed. But I will show you the real thing. Community is being suppressed because we don't understand that the human is the glory of the man. The man we are suppressing by fighting is dying. Can't you see that fighting is dying? The man will go out. The man will go out. I will be glad to see that. You see all of that. What is happening? You know you are suppressing sisters. You know you are suppressing women. You know you are suppressing women. You know you are suppressing women. Because the human is the glory of the man. What is happening to us in Africa? You see suppressing our women. You all are here to quit and go back when the man dies out. The man dies out. If he dies out and marries 20 wives, he is like married 5, 7, 8 wives. But the women cannot do something like that for the man. You see our madness? So we are saying that because he is a man. What makes him a man is that he can do injustice, but the women cannot do it. Is that not madness? What makes him a man is to control and to protect. What makes him a man is to control and to use us. I am not going to make a mistake there, so if you do not want to make a mistake there, Adam was just you. You make it up, make it Adam's place. But because when Joseph or John married, do you not think that for this cost, a man can live once, father or mother? Do you not think that it is his safety, a price, a price that makes father or mother, a friend or brother? Because you are the sinner. Because you are the offender. You are the offender. You will be offended. You may be good for the continuation. But in our own madness today, what makes us mad? That once you offend me, affect my life. You will not come to affect me as you saw our neighbor. You are the sinner and you are a fool. Man is that you fall and die for the continuation. That is why you are a sinner. That is why you have made your business and the glory of God. To carry some glory, you are made to feel like Christ. You are not given to feel what God is. When you get blessed, you can carry a glory. When there is patacata, you can manage it. You carry a glory of God. If a man saw, what is that? The glory of God. But because a woman is living here, what if a man saw? What is that? The glory of God. Today believers are trying to do a test today. They see that there is something that is not in me. They see that my eyes are still closed because he is not telling me. He is not telling me. That was the one that was telling me the truth. The truth of God has not been done. What has been done? I tell you a truth. I tell you a truth. Any question, accept it. In the journey of chapter 3, when you are sitting and you are reading, you will have dominion. Let them rule. Abuse over everything. But in chapter 3, they will say, what can I do to your husband? And you will now have dominion over him. That was it. They were to rule. They now rule us. Before you tell me you will do that, let us take question. Question with duration. I'm talking to you in the end here today. First question. I got two questions.\"}\n"
