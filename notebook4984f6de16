One thing God said about Abraham is that Abraham is able to command what? His household. So we are trying to bring out a very, very important thing that for those of us that are married and have children we should be, we should see it as a very, very crucial thing. Not just for me to be saved, but me and my house. And for those of us who are yet to enter into the institution of marriage, who are yet to begin to have biological children then we should know that one thing about God is fruitfulness. It is fruitfulness. It is fruitfulness. We were saved to serve until, you can say it was by my life that this person came to know the Lord. And this person is standing in the faith established. Then you don't have a coast. Your coast is indeed very narrow. And so it becomes very crucial for us. And there was something we linked together last week was that for people who have been set into family because the Bible says there is a difference between a virgin and the married both for the male and the female. For people who are married, the joy of God is that that thing that God will do with them in the life of other people should begin in their home. He said, why did he make them one? Because he seek a godly seed. So for the married, their primary point of assignment, in fact, their Jerusalem before they begin to move to Judea and then to Samaria, to the uttermost part of the earth, is their immediate family. Those were the things we established last week. And we charge ourselves that if men will struggle to make sure that their physical inheritance don't pass to other people's children, they will right-wing, they will protect it, they will make sure that children know where their lands, where their things are because they don't want it to die. They want to pass it on. How much more should we, as believers, make sure that our Christian heritage don't die with us? How much more should we make sure that we pass it on to our biological children? This is our point of emphasis. And I trust the Lord that the blessings of these things, will remain with us in Jesus' name. Now, today has been our last Friday, last Friday of the month of July, usually our time of prayer. Last Monday, thank you, last Monday in the month of July, which is our time of prayer, I want us to look, take our text, I've mentioned that before, from Luke chapter 18. Luke chapter 18 is a very familiar scripture. Almost everybody can quote Luke 18 verse 1. Almost everybody. Luke 18 verse 1. He said, Then he spoke a parable to them, that men always ought to pray, and not to, to lose heart. That's the King James Version. Is there another version? Jesus told the disciples a story. From that story, all he wanted to show them, is that they should always pray, and not give up. They should always pray, and not give up. Any other translation of that? Any other one? NLT. NLT. They should always pray, and never give up. Okay? So, we are looking at, today is our day of prayer, and we are looking at something that the Lord said here. Why is the matter of giving up, eh, tied to the matter of prayer? Men ought always to pray, and never give up. Why did Jesus tie giving up and prayer together? Why is there a... Are you understanding what I'm about to say? Why is there a tie between giving up and prayer? Jesus wants them to know that they ought always to pray. And this is something from Jesus. You ought always to pray, and don't give up. Why is giving up tied to prayer? You know, it brings some things to mind. It makes some things clear. Huh? That, something about prayer, is that, something crucial about prayer, is not just that you are prayed. It's also that, you don't lose heart. Something about prayer. There's this thing about prayer. You see, when it comes to God, we pray to God. We pray to God. We pray to God. Jesus told a story to make His disciples know that when it comes to prayer, it is important for you to know that when it comes to talking to God about something, when it comes to bringing something to God in prayer, whether as petition, whether as request, whether as supplication, whichever way, it is important to know that you should remind that there is tendency to lose heart. There is tendency to lose heart. There is tendency to get tired. Tendency to, who? Tendency to get tired. Those, that tendency is there when it comes to talking to God. It's not as if God don't answer prayers. It's not as if God don't hear us when we cry. It's not as if God don't listen. In fact, there's this scripture that gives me so much rest. Two scriptures in the Bible. One in the Old Testament, one in the New Testament. The first one is in Isaiah. It said, while you are here speaking, eh? I'll be here. In fact, before you come, I will answer. That is not a God afar off. It's a God that is near. What made God to be afar is iniquity. It's not as new. In fact, I wonder scripture that gives me rest about prayer is this one in the New Testament in 1 John chapter 5 that says, we know that whatever we ask according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, then we can be sure that we have whatsoever we ask from Him. But, it is just important for us to know eh? That as much as God answers before we call, as much as God hears us while we are praying, as much as God is here and is here in everything, eh? Everything. When we say, He that gives ear, will He not hear? He that gives eyes, will He not see? And why is God saying that He is different from other gods? What is one thing that God says about Himself? He said, they have eyes, they cannot see. They have ears, they cannot hear. That those who worship them are like them. Eh? He said, but ask for me. Eh? Call unto me and I will answer you. Is that not? So, you see, the point I am making is that as much as we know that God answers prayer, as much as we know that God hears us when we call, as much as we know that God lives things, it is so crucial for us to know that there is something about God answering us speedily, God hearing us hearing us as we are talking, God listening to us as we are saying that God is listening and is doing something about it. Eh? In that thing that God is doing, it is important to know that there is a tendency for you to give up. Why? Why is He not talking about this issue? Why is He not talking like this? God hears us. When we pray, He listens. When we call, He answers. And yet He is saying, you ought always to pray and not give up. What is He telling us? It is just telling to make us see eh, that the manner, eh, the manner, the way, the pattern in which God answers speedily, quickly, eh, and hears us as we are, as we call, eh, is not as man thinks. It is not the way you look at it critically. It is not, eh, the ways of God is windy. You know what I mean by windy? Eh? You know what I mean by windy? When something is not straight, His ways are windy. Eh? Eh, on that, on that He says, God moves in a mysterious way. The way He moves, sometimes He will be there. You look as if He is not there. Be there. He is answering the prayers. And yet He looks as if God is not there at all. You will think He is not there. You will think He is absent. So, that is why the matter of you ought to, you know, you don't give up. And then, another thing about this answering us is that God answers us in the way that He has bested the totality of His plans for our lives. Mind you, that plan is not with you. You don't know it. You don't know it. The plan is with Him. I want to use this personal example as an illustration. Then I will also use other examples in the Bible. Personal example. Some years back, we were in Jaws. And my wife was working with a private school that had a church arm, a primary arm, and a secondary arm. The primary arm is very close to where we live. That was where she was first employed. And we were there. But later they got to know, when they got to look at her certificate, that she is a graduate, left school with a 2-1, and a counselor. And they needed such at the secondary section. They felt they were underutilizing her in the primary section. They would rather take her to the secondary section. The secondary section is so far from our house. It's like traveling. And because at that time, the family income was so low. What I normally do is that, I would drop them with a car. Then we still have our second born then, as a baby. So I would drop them with a car in that school. We employed a maid to be with her. Who stays with her in a room, provided. Then she would go to class to teach them, pick her. So what I normally do, since it's not far from the house, and not so far from where I was teaching, I would drop them with a car. I would leave the car there. I would trek down to where I would teach. So when she closes, she would call me. I would have closed earlier. I would trek back. Then pick everybody with the car. We'd go home. We looked for sushi. People must agree on the totality of the thing. Huh? So they encamped by the Red Sea. And through to the war, not too long, Pharaoh was coming with all the army. They didn't like saying, Go! Kill them before they get here. Oh! Angels of God, scatter them. Arrows of God, finish them. Oh! Baba! Cut off their head. Instead of Michael cutting off their head, they were getting closer. They were getting closer. They were getting closer. And closer. And at a point, what did they do instead of continue praying? Moses, this is what we told you. You should have left us in Egypt to die. Now we'll be done by the Red Sea. Look at what you have caused. It did not make us to die in Egypt. Not to come and die here. Eh Moses? And they began to complain against God. Complain against Moses. Go to God. Go to God. What should we do? We should not have brought us out of Egypt. And they began to... What have happened to them? They no more continued in prayer. They have what? They have given up. They have begun to say things. That is why if we check that same story in Ezekiel. That is why if we check that same story in Ezekiel. God said, they provoke me by the Red Sea. I thought of destroying them. But for my namesake it will not be defined before the Egyptians. I allowed them to cross the sea. God would have killed them there. Why? Instead of men praying, they stopped praying. Because it looks like God was not amped up. Why? Instead of men praying they stopped praying. Because it looks like God was not amped up. They began to complain. They began to curse God. They began to speak against God. Which type of life did He even bring us here? Why did He even save us? And I hear some people say, what did God even save me for? Is it not better not to be saved? Is it not? You know people say, how can you bring out? Sometimes we lose as if God does not answer prayer. But eventually, contrary to what they thought, did God answer the prayer? Did God answer? Did He answer according to their request? No. Rather, what He did was that He brought darkness between them. The cloud that was before them left their front and came between them and these people. They thought they would catch up but God came in between. For them, God should have killed them but God did not kill them that way. Because God has a higher plan in His mind. And so, after that, God had done that. God gave this one light. And then, even now Moses was confused. And God said, Moses, you are so telling. Why are you crying to me? Tell them to keep going. For Moses who could not tell them because there was no road. And God said, okay, search for what is in your hand and do that. And they began to walk on dry land. And they walked and walked and walked to the other side. And when they had finished crossing, God now removed the darkness. Contrary to the way they could not have thought, could they have been able to imagine all of that? They could not. That is, God moved in a mysterious way. God does not answer us according to our own limits and God does not allow me to do like this and God does not answer like this. No more time we plan out the answer we look like. But God does not answer that way. And then when they were at the other side, eh, and then those ones began to run, then God now did something. God now removed the wheel of the Asherah. And the thing was slowing down. The thing was slowing down. And then they came. God swallowed them up. And what did God do with that water that swallowed them up? God got a name for himself. Is that not true? Do you know that that was why the people of Jericho, the people of Ai, all of them, the people of the Gibeomites, why were they afraid? They said, this God is a God that that parted the Red Sea. This God is a God of the West, He is a God of the West. This God is a God of the West. Isn't this the God of the West? Isn't this the God of the West? You know that Jesus was a king of the West. Didn't He create the nations of the in me oh god he has he did not he did not let us believe it's working out something hey this the this thing that the shepherd have over the sheep is far far much more than the sheep have over themselves are you aware look at you and your children who have must take over the children for example all that we wish to always be alive i know it will happen to her but the essence of which you wish it is cannot be compared to the reason which you wish it as the father or the mother you know that you know you are praying that people should not happen to you but i'm telling you meet your father you will see how much your father will pray much more for you than for himself that god hey hey god don't let me die oh this but nothing must happen to my children those who own i have more stake over the things that are home god has more stake over us that we have to take over our life we should understand that we should know it men ought always to pray so tonight as we pray this even as we pray don't begin to tell yourself oh when i've been praying i've been praying i don't go god even yet no don't behave like this like i didn't see don't begin to bring complete sometimes you know if not for god's mercy that day they would have finished their testimony but when i read it later in the prophet that god said i will have destroyed them by the red sea but i consider my name that what would be this chance what would they say they would say i don't have power to lead them through this thing so for my name's sake i allowed them to go i allowed them to go and it was just messy that i brought them to the other side and i keep praying oh no you know honestly i keep praying every day oh lord always be gracious to me and god be gracious to me because sometimes i may not be different from these people in some things i say in some things i do that's why many times i'll just say god please be gracious to me let's be gracious to me and that's what you are talking from this evening ah lord god almighty baba be gracious unto me be gracious unto me be gracious unto me lord in all you do in your workings over my life oh lord be gracious unto me no be gracious unto me lord in my feelings in my shortcomings in sometimes my own belief is sometimes my murmuring is sometimes my failure oh lord be gracious unto me be gracious unto me be gracious unto me lord look upon me with mercy and lord be gracious unto me in all circumstances of life in all situations of life lord god almighty be gracious unto me lord be gracious unto me like you were gracious unto our father be gracious unto me Be gracious unto me in my shortfalls.

And we were able to consider the way of peace in our last discussion before we took prayer. And one thing that was central to that discussion is the fact that what makes this period perilous? It's what? It's what? The nature of man. There's nothing perilous in the time. It is the wickedness of men, the selfishness of men, the self-centeredness of people, the greed. Look at what we listed that day in Ephesians. We listed it in the Bible, not even that day. We listed it in the Bible in 2 Samuel. Moses chapter 3. You know, arrogant, proud, all kinds of things were mentioned. And so, we trust the Lord that our path will be a path of peace. And we will walk in the path of peace in the name of Jesus Christ. One pivotal point of our prayer last week, which I want to just hint on quickly before we move on. For today. If you remember when we were to take our prayer last week. We made reference to Psalm 32, verse 8 and 9. That scripture is a very crucial scripture, honestly, for believers. For, for, for. for the disciples those who intend to really follow jesus as we round up 2020 and move towards 2021 um because the lord said i will i will i will lead you in the path that is best for you i would advise you and i would wash over you however do not be like the ox that lacks understanding do not be like the ox in fact the energy says do not be like the senseless ox until you put a beat and a booty and a bread in his mouth you cannot control it and i said that scripture is so crucial it's so crucial god will be doing several things as we close up this year and as we enter into the next year but um i'm appealing to lord how he's so crucial that we don't lack understanding it's so crucial that we are able to understand we are able to you know pick the sickness of god recognize when he's limiting us recognize when he's pushing us recognize when he's pulling us back we must not lack understanding and one center prayer week is that god please help us so that we don't lack understanding god please help us now uh if you if you remember i want to go to um our our our central focus for today now if you remember when we were starting the whole of this thing about um before before we took the way of peace out of the discussion we are trying to look at a very big um direction that should i call it could i call it um um eternal life should i call it living with eternity in view how do we name it how what direction should we go but the direction will be going further today in all of in that um uh issue as he should i raised with us is that i want us to have a reflection let's have the reflection on the on this or a poor epistle to the people of ephesus you know the book of ephesians let's have a reflection i want us to reflect on that book epistle it is about Kings chapter 3, 18, 1-13. ETHISIM on that book as we reflect on that book i believe it will be answering so many things that the holy spirit want to raise with us so many that we want to raise with us will be will be will be will be coming across them in that book is it living with eternity in view will be i can't will be encountering it is it living um for the purpose of god will be encountering it is it living practically for grace will be encountering it as you know i just saw i perceived in my spirit that we should go that way it will answer so many of the things we want to answer to and i trust the lord that as we do so it will bring great blessing to us all in jesus name let's turn to the book of ephesians efficient efficient and i want to read something to you just just as a as a background to that book there is this um introductory something here this is individual that god used at a point in history for the sake of revival and particularly to put the church aright at the time when there was so much confusion about doctrine i don't have any of us know john calvin i want to first know john calvin john calvin you have only heard about him In the Gimnazocao In Gimnazocao In Gimnazocao some things about him look at what he said he said efficient is addressed to a group of believers who are rich beyond measure in christ yet living as beggars and only because they are ignorant of their wealth efficient is addressed to a group of believers who are rich beyond measure in christ yet living as beggars and only because they are ignorant of their wealth all begins by describing in chapter one to three the content of the christian time heavily bank accounts please note he said they were rich beyond measure in christ so when paul was a star paul began to first make them know what is in that account for them and what is in that account and you remember that i don't know how many of us around one time when i was when i was using this language yes can you remember the language about banks available balance and then legal balance the legal balance and available balance you should remember those that's this language now when you said they were rich beyond measure in christ what was he talking about the legal balance so the first thing that paul did was to dig into between chapter one and chapter three to dig into look how that you have although in the available balance you have zero naira you are not spending i hope you are getting i hope that from that example i believe after inside what i want to say that so let's move let me move on now you said paul began by describing in chapter one to three the content of the christian heavenly bank accounts look at the things he counted adoption acceptance redemption forgiveness wisdom inheritance the seal of the holy spirit life grace 容易 ngulia life grace映 affor negatbings life grace concrete grace forgiveness forgiveness wisdom inheritance seal of the Holy Spirit life grace my soul and grace 충 turnover grace might,etc in short every spiritual blessing Paul excited the spiritual blessing in chapter four to see the the Christian the Christian learn a spiritual work rooted in the spiritual wealth a spiritual work in the spiritual wealth I don't know how many of you have read the book of Washmanee sit walk how many of us have read that book you have read that book of Washmanee what he was trying to say is that don't understand how you sit eh you will not be able to walk w-a-l-k oh you will not be able to walk if you don't know how you sit you'll be walking wrongly you can for you to walk rightly you must understand what the city that is what was saying should be as a result of what your wealth once you don't understand your wealth what will that place on your work your work will not be all right your work will be will be you know it will be cumbersome it will be cumbersome your work and that is what is referring to as living as beggars living below what you ought to live living outside that understanding now the Christian learn okay for we are the work when you're created in Christ Jesus for good work that we should work in them now he said that I want us to move um quickly into look I also want to bring in something for Washmanee Washmanee when he said stand Washmanee divided further for those of you who read that book you know divided further that that that that work which is between chapter 4 and chapter 6 should be divided again into two there is a work that has to do working with God that has to do with the Christian life but when they get to chapter 6 verse 10 you must also learn how to stand when he says system says finally my brethren be strong in the law and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil so for Neil for washman he is saying that in working the believer must understand standing it's not only to walk they must only understand the place of a standing but you know the past the past that As we go to this book, the words of my body in this book are withdrawn more on believers linking our our our words and our work. You know, work to work. Because once you don't attend the world, ah, the working. What is so crucial for us today is how is your working with the Lord? But this working, this WLK, Ibala Ononi, working with God, is something today, ehm, how would I say it now, trying to work with God, not on the busy place for us, and so, the working becomes very difficult, if not impossible. What you notice more is that people will say, when it comes to living the life of God, there is this small empathy that it takes that we need the grace of God. Yes, that is true, we need the grace of God. But people speak, if yet to be given, trying to bring out. They speak, we say, bro, please, it is not correct the way you are living like this. A believer should not be selfish, and God will give me grace. Are you understanding this? This point of, feet of anger, you will say, what did we say? Ah, we are trusting God for grace. Now, as understanding, you will understand. It is coming from things that God will yet do. It means what? What He has done. Say this, there is this. Okay. Let me link what I want to link. I believe it, it will still be clear. You know what we are reading, some of those things in 2 Timothy chapter 3. The last thing they spoke about is what? Having a form of godliness. But denying the power of God. Denying the power. Denying the power. Say that, with what Jesus said in Matthew 24. About the perilous time. The end time. He said, but he, because, because, iniquity will abound. The law of many will rise. But he that endures to the end, shall be what? Shall be saved. Telling you that, iniquity will be abounding. Is it only possible for your love not to be cold? It is what? It's a misnomer. It's not the normal. What happened is that you should be able to do what? Endure to the end. Enduring to the end is saying that it is the normal. It's not because Jesus is expecting the believers to be able to have their working with God. By some will power that they have. But because God has made what? Enough what? Provision. If I go to, I open to chapter 1 and I draw your, call your attention to something. Look at, look at this, look at this brethren. He says, the heavenly bank account. He talks about adoption. He talks about adoption. What is adoption? Adoption is not acceptance. It's adoption. But there is also acceptance. There is adoption, but there is also acceptance. There are two different things. It is, adoption is one thing. Acceptance is another one. Redemption is another thing. He says that, do you know that believers understand adoption? What's God meant by adoption? Who will be, who will be splitting these things? Inefficient. What God meant by adoption? What God meant by acceptance? And all of that. Do you know what He meant by adoption? Do you know that? You know when I say understand, I don't mean have the knowledge of. I hope you're understanding me. Eh? You know, you may have knowledge of something, but it is not really your life. Eh? Into what it means. What God meant by adoption? Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. Adoption. That you are an adopted child of God. If you see the amount of things it will take care of. If you see the way it will affect, how you live in this life. Eh? If you see the way it will affect you come to the place of prayer. Is, honestly, it will be amazing and so brethren, I want you to just take a journey through this thing because I feel like if you take this journey, it leveralize everything. There is a basis for concern, there is instead of concern, there is there, it fights for fairly good things. Yes. Many of the things I want to capture independently, we will capture it as we reflect on the book of Ephesians. So today we are looking at a reflection on Ephesians 1, we have one we have, so I don't know how many we have, but a reflection on the book of Ephesians. And the first thing we have there in chapter 1, I will not go more than just around verse 3 or 4 for today. It says, Now, in opening up, in opening up the letter, the first thing that Paul opened up for the Ephesians in verse 3, in verse 3. He said, Blessed be the God and Father. Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ. Opening up the heavenly bank account. Now, the background that we are drawing from this place is that the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to be worshipped, to be praised, to be praised, to be praised, to be praised, to be appreciated, all to be thanked. Huh? For what? He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ. Now, in this place, Paul just mentioned that there are spiritual blessings. Isn't it? There are spiritual blessings. And those blessings, they are where? As we have discussed. So, the heavenly places. The heavenly places, to make it practical, is what? They are already provided for. Huh? We're in the ledger balance. Why are they in the ledger balance? Because we are in Christ. It is not. We are blessed in Christ. The first thing I want to draw to you, I want to call our attention to, by this, by this statement. Huh? Number one, for the believer to know that the focus of God upon their life is not first nor primarily material blessings. We have to understand that what is made available for us, the focus of God's dealings upon our life, is their worth. Their worth, their spiritual worth. Our blessings is very crucial. How it is, we must get clear and properly understand, is that, I put it now. Okay. Look at something in Psalm 36. Look at Psalm 36. I will come back to this place. Look at Psalm 36. Psalm 36. I want to read, I want to call our attention to something between verse 1 and verse... 5. It's just 12 verses. 5 or 4, Jerry, but please look at something. New King James says, An oracle within my heart, Consigned the transgression of the wicked. What do you see? His Bible says, There is no war. There is no fear of God before their eyes. For he flatters within himself. In his own eyes, when he finds out his iniquity, and when he hates. The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit. He has ceased to be wise and to do good. He divides his wickedness on his bed. He sets himself in a way that is not good. He does not abhor evil. But what do you see in verse 5? What do you see in verse 5? What do you see in verse 5? Your faithfulness is... Are you getting something at all? Are you getting something at all? Have the fear of God before him. He divides wickedness and he does evil continuously. He speaks deceit. He goes on doing that. But what is the first response of God? Mercy. Make them not to have anything. Make them not to be materially bled. Cause them to die. They will be wicked. They will be going on. They will prosper. They will have things. And you will be wondering. The wicked. Me, I am godly. Why the wicked? I am trying to explain something. Please get these things clear. Nothing further. He says, your mercy is on the Lord. It's in the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. It's like the great mountain. Your judgments are great and deep waters. God continually. In fact, you should not hear the light of tomorrow. Am I correct? Sometimes, I get the message. Damn. You stupid God. People don't see you. You are God deceiving yourself. You see that same man. He who apply for job. And if you apply for job like this. You got the job. 4 to 6 thousand in a month. He apply for that. He got this. He got a visa. He's going abroad. Should such a man, get such things? Are you understanding me? To do this, in about the weekend. You say, your mercy. God will give you example. Then for example. What Christ. If we are in Christ. Christ came to offer eh is primarily and fundamentally material blessing then we are not blessed because the men who also cause God and have nothing to do with God have the same thing are you understanding me are you understanding me are you understanding me now it is so important for you to understand that the bible says that we were blessed with blessings in Christ and I also want to call your attention when Christ left what did he say when Christ was about to leave what did he tell the disciples in John chapter 14. eh I am going to prepare a place so the prepared place is not a place here what am I making it's finished what we finished what was finished was that everything we need everything we need every blessing we need was for anybody who is in Christ everything came to a leisure balance but we should understand that the focus of God on the believer is primarily and and first and foremost and primarily uh he wasn't speaking of something that is material you if you look at it from the material point of view you will not understand the judgments of God you know one of the fathers that have very such a similar problem I was always going to confusion before God called his attention which of the father which of the fathers have that confusion David where do we find that 73 that same problem he said as for him he almost thought that God was not good that God was bad he said when he was considering the prosperity of the wicked he went where they don't have problems be that is righteous many are the afflictions of the righteous these ones don't have afflictions everything was going well everything was going good he said until he entered the temple of God and God now showed him that actually what matters about a man is that a man hence haven't said that in that place I haven't said that. I haven't said that in Ephesians chapter one. Let's go back to Ephesians. Now who has blessed us with special blessings in Christ? Now the where I want to stop today is the verse four and that is where I want to play enter. You see and I wanted to try as many as many versions as possible for this verse four. He said just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Please on that translation. If you are reading please use the mic. Come on English Bible. God chose us in Christ to be holy and blameless in God's presence before the creation of man. God chose us in Christ to be holy and blameless in God's presence before the creation of man. of the world. Do you get that? God chose us in Christ to be holy and blameless in his presence when? Before the foundation of the world. End of that presentation. Ephesians 1 4. Even as in his love he choose us actually picked us up for himself as his own. Come again. Even as in his love. Even as his word. His love. His love. He choose us actually picked us up for himself for himself as his own. As his own. What are they? Not his own. There's a difference between God being the God of all and being the father of some. He's the God of all but the father of some. His own. Please you have not finished it. That's actually that's what I actually actually wanted. Yes. In Christ. In Christ. Before the foundation of the world. Before the foundation of the world. Please my brother sit down. Now I want you to I want us to look a little bit into this matter of I want to begin from picked us before the foundation of the world. I will now come to as his own. When he says he picked us before the foundation of the world. What does that simply mean? Without going to any big theology. Any time to use big grammar. What does that mean? When he said before the foundation of the world. What does that mean? Before he created the world. Does that look something possible? Does that look something possible? Brethren we are not talking of. Before he chose you in him. Let me let me first say something. From the point before salvation. Whosoever believe. But when you find yourself in salvation. You must understand that the choice was from the but before the beginning. I don't know that you understand me. Where they come from before salvation. What should it be? Whosoever believe in him shall not perish. Once you know that you have been saved. You are saved. What should you now understand? That actually that you were actually taking. You should understand come in your mother's womb. Is that not what it is? Is that not what it is? Was the same truth concerning Josiah. You remember Josiah? Who remember Josiah? That came to power at age 8 through the young prophet. The power that came to house of David. Josiah. That child will do what? Break this altar. He's going to pour the trust of the author along with this thing. That is what that prophet said. Blood the grave, the word of God. Pray and stand And dwell hereily when His blood on your side is, continues to stand. if it is the word of god that you speak even after you have died your word will still stand. Except if your word is your word you would understand therefore if your word is your word, you matter why God is standing except if your word is your word. You know what? But if your word is the word of God Even after your death Your word will still be standing It's the tongue of the man Leave him, let him rest Before salvation Is Whosoever believes Should not perish But when you are coming to salvation You must understand Adoption You were believing and you were repenting That God actually chose you But that rather The world was Anybody knew that The world to me ever before time was That was when God actually chose you If you ask me how I will tell you I don't know But if you ask me is it true I will tell you if you believe anything else Then you are a fool Because the gospel must sound as foolishness To those who are perishing But for us who believe It is what The wisdom of God And what The power of God It is the wisdom of God It is the power of God I can tell you that thing Eh That's the truth about it I'm talking about adoption When he says you are a child of God He says he picked us at his own That picking Is not a matter of time It's in a matter of what Timelessness Eternal life Eternity I It's in an eternity On the eternal scale On the eternal scale That I'm a child of God That is why you hear from people When you hear them talking Yoruba Say ah I want more Agba You know this You hear they are thinking of people Who are diabolical Who have some extra natural life Is that not the truth What do you call Olon Olon Oba Ba Agba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Olon Oba Ah Someone Agba O John have more than He must back The others have more Agba If you want to know Mystical children Please some one And if you don't know I'm telling you Now that you are Because you don't know Who you pay something Can you get some kind of name know what i want to say is that sure god was even somebody in time me i'm in timelessness who you deify live in time me i was chosen before time addressing i want what i want to talk about is this matter of adoption understanding adoption let me also explain it from another way to you you know something happened this afternoon and i believe god was preparing me for this message uh i don't plan to to like i promise everybody i will always make sure that i want to try and make sure that before it is 6 30 we are sharing grace and then we are living this place i want to i always want to try that i want to well you know i saw god preparing for this message this evening i drove to town and i was driving through town i came to a point some people by the by the market yeah you know people will be waving down vehicles that they can cross so they wave me that i should please let them so i slowed down so the people were passing but in my conventional way i don't normally stop completely i will slow down i'll see you know when you don't when you don't fully apply the brake for automatic car they will still be moving small small they will be moving very gradually so i didn't fully apply the brake i just applied the brake to a point so the car was still moving but now i'm very slow so that they can pass and i was moving close to them because i was moving close to them i noticed the crossing there was a ball it should be either between 18 other between it should be a teenager if he's not a teenager maybe a young person but he cannot be up to 25. you know sometimes retardation can affect could have affected him so i was expecting the boy because he was deep he's look very young and doesn't mean to cross fast maybe early women we were walking slow but the boy was coming last so i not look more closely at the boi and I noticed that is actually a boi that has some kind of deformity and retardation he was holding a rose he was holding a stick and as he was walking you were something like this vibrating vibrating and working he was vibrating and walking vibrating like that i'm working on him he was doing like this vibrating and walking so and i noticed that actually before i was giving a And I'll slow down much more the more until he pass. You know, immediately he pass. Yoli Goziah spoke within my heart. You know, I left the steering. I said he could not move very fast. And I held my head. And I was about whipping. Yoli Goziah told me something. He said, for him, it was not a choice. For that boy, it was not a choice. Then, the other thing he said is that white song, white song, who are not like this, have no cause to be grateful. That was the word. They have no cause to be grateful. They just feel that being alive and okay is just something that is their choice. Then, like the flash of a light, the Lord also took me back to this topic that I was preparing for today, adoption. And then my life, you know the way spirit things normally work. I think it is a, you know, three hour thing can be in two seconds. Do you know in two seconds? Eh? The Lord took me from my birth today. From my birth, from when I was born till date. From when I could remember when I was a child. And the Lord was counting. Do you remember when you took matches and went to the mechanic workshop? And went to the mechanic workshop. You saw the petrol tank. You don't know what it was. I didn't know what it was. And I wanted to look inside. And there was no touch light. So, I took matches. I put it into the thing and then put my eyes to see what was inside. The next thing I heard was an explosion. When the thing exploded, it took me, when I landed, I thought maybe a spirit or something. So, I began to run. Me again. What is it? What is it? Then I began to come back to my senses. The Lord said, it was because I knew you before time. That was why I kept you at that time. You could not have been different from this boy. He fled on some very deep things. I'm looking at him. The fact that you had begun to direct your, because you were chosen before you were born. So, by the time you were born, God began to direct your life one way. Begin to preserve you from some things. Begin to, you know. And you just thought that it was because you were good. It was because you were lucky. It was because. And then you began to, you began to perish the sin. You began to do the sin. You began to do the sin. You did the sin. Did the sin. Did the sin. Did the sin. And then one day you became born again. And at some point, you began to look at some people and want to share. We will show you that Jesus. As if you actually chose that Jesus. You need to know, come to God. It is whosoever believes. That is what you must understand. And that is why the Bible says, go into the world and do what? Preach to God through to who? The Bible did not say, go there and be looking at people. No, I will not preach to you. You, you are a bad boy. God cannot save you. And they, no. You preach to all. This way. It says, no man can come to me except the Father draws him. Reflected. I was looking up and looking down and looking sideways. I didn't know what I was looking at. And the next thing that I saw was that I was between the bicycle spoke and the bicycle. You understand me? Sorry. Motorcycle. The thing just crushed me. And then, the next thing, hey, hey, hey, hey. And then, this and that and that and that. Then, you know what? You know what just came to me this afternoon? He said, after that time, why didn't something happen to your brain? On the road. Why didn't something happen? Do you understand? For that boy, it was not a choice. So, why didn't something happen to you? You went through all of that. You went through all of that. For the first one, on my face, all the black thing was off. You know when something burns. You know the way your, all your face will not be yellow. Everything became, because the whole face was, the expression just burnt. That was how it was. Because it's not like I was mad. I didn't know. The whole thing was just . It just burnt the thing. I didn't know what happened. I had a question. I had a question. I had a question. I had a question. I had a question. I had a question. I had a question. I had a question. I did not know. I just knew that. But the point I want to bring out is that today, the faith is back. Why did something happen beyond that? Pick that. Pick. And I want you to begin to pick your life. Some things you call, ha. Ha. It's so coincidental. A black person's face is black. How could that happen? Why? I don't see. No. I don't see. Why? Look, God has begun to work in your life even when you were a non-believer. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Before you believe, is it after you believe that God will throw you away? Pray then. Think straight. In that flash of a light, eh? I remember I said that at Palace Hotel. The day I went to swim. I went there to swim. My brothers have told me, I didn't know I was just this kind of child when I was a child. But maybe because God also was taking me somewhere. Maybe God did all these things to put me to understand adoption. There children were swimming. I went where I was told not to come. I didn't know those swans. Why they said children and adults? Was that one was deeper than the other. I didn't understand all of those things. I thought water was water. My brothers who were sitting somewhere relaxing. I left that side and jumped into the other one. When I jumped, my leg could not reach the ground like the other one. I began to struggle with them. I could not call them again. You see, I was under water. It was about 6 to 8 feet. The one for children was about 2 to 3 feet. When you stand in it, you can easily swim. So, when I did like this, came up, I wanted to call. I went down again. This day, we see, came up again. I wanted to call again. I went down again. What I remember vividly, vividly. Not that somebody... Something you are trying to recollect. I remember vividly. Was that when I went down the third time, I gave up. I gave up that. Then, this is the end. And as I went down, I just knew that a hand picked me from under that water. And then took me and placed me beside where, you know, by the base. On the, on the tide. You know, the place is tide. It just made me, it just took me. I sat down there. It just made me, it just carried me and put me and I sat there. And that was all. Whether it was a human being, I don't know. Whether it was a spirit, I don't know. Whatever it carried me that day, just put me there. When it put me there, I was in that shock. I could not do anything. My brain did not understand what happened to me. I was just, you know when you become unusually calm. Because you know you actually died. I became unusually calm. I just sat there. I was just there. I was just there. I was just there. Like that. Like that. Till we left that place. I was in that thing. I could remember very vividly. I was in that shock. I didn't tell my brother. I didn't tell anyone. Because they have told me, don't go to this side. I know many times too, when we see elders of faith warning us about certain things, we feel we know better. You know the same thing. Faith of our fathers. When our fathers, they did not know God very well. We can there's a new revelation in God. But the point I'm trying to make is that, all of these things was reflected this afternoon. That as you look at all of those points, which of them was my choice? Which of them was that by my will, I came out of it? It was just because there was, there is what? Work prepared ahead to be done. And so, this one cannot die. What I want to bring out is that, if God was busy masterminding our life from birth. Sorry. Mastermind our life before conception. Mastermind our life at conception. And began to control it. Because you know for instance, if I have been born a female, it should have been a little different. Do you agree with me? Do you agree to that? If you have been a male, it's a comfort. We all have radically different. If you have been a female, do you see that you have so many choices you made? Do you know that you are the one who chooses? Nobody will be choosing you. Do you understand what I am trying to bring out? Try to look at this as if I was not born a Yoruba. Imagine that if I was born. Try to look at all of those things. All of those things that worked together. That came together. And became something great that is solid. What I am trying to bring to you. That adoption makes us to understand. That ever before we came into existence, God began to work around our lives. Before we were formed in the mother's womb, He knew us. And began to shape and began to direct and was working around our lives. Ever before we came to Him. So after we finally came to Him, why are we not coming to an understanding that His love for us is eternal? Ever before I began to pray, I began to love God. I began to want to follow God. And I want to take all the care to make sure I follow God. God has been working around my life to make sure I enter into His plan. Is it now that you can fall out of that plan? I mean whatever. Living useless life. Eh? God was teleguiding. You know? Eleji. You know? You know? Motipekele the first time. Motipeke. And He was working. He was busy working. He was busy working. I want to ask you. I want to ask you. Now that finally, eh? There is now a change of fatherhood. You are not just, eh? A creation of God. God is the God of all. But the Father of some. Brethren. When you were seeing the God of all, in that all, you were not here. You were not here. You were a focus. He remembered you. He was busy teleguiding you. You know? You know? Eh? You know? Eh? Oh! You are God of that. You are God of who? And He was busy working. No. He should not die. No. He should be. No. He should be a female. No. He should be born here. And God was teleguiding. Teleguiding. Teleguiding. Eventually when you now become the Father, you fall. What will be the level and the extent of the teleguiding? I want to stop here today brethren. And I want you to. Two things I want you to do. Eh? The first thing is to build up your faith. You know? If a man says to you, ah, I want to praise God I want to praise God I want to praise God I want to praise God He says, Blessed be the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. You see this? God this evening. Can you bless God? I don't know how you have been living your life. I don't know what you have been thinking. How you have been looking at your life. But can you, can you particularly bless God? Can you bless God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ? Can you bless Him? Can you bless this God and say, God is the father of God. He knows you. He knows this. I bless you for my life. I bless you for my life. I bless you. I particularly blessing you for my life. To see myself. You for my life. You for my life. I bless you for who I have. I bless you for who I have. Lord Jesus Christ. You to pray. Is that a believer? Walking around my life. Of the wicked. Used to rest. Came to you. Your came to me. I want you to pray. I want you to pray. Oh Lord. Help me to realize that your love for me is eternal. Help me to know. When God was we cannot comprehend it. We cannot comprehend it. We cannot comprehend it. And the last prayer you have to pray. Oh God. Help me to be to be secured in your love. Lord remove from me this feeling of insecurity. Hey with me. I open to God. God was God was walking around your life. Now that he has been secured in your love. And this thing. I live as a Christian. You're not able to walk. There is a walking as a Christian. A walking with God. God did for us to man. Now to God.
