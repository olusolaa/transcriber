God greatly desires a godly home for us. These are words of restoration and instruction on righteousness from Family Tech Ministry. May you be blessed as you do so. Today we are looking at something very very important as we start up the year. Somebody asked me a question. He said, the pastor said, sir, God promises for long life. Is it not for Christians? And the pastor asked him, God promises for long life. Is it not for Christians? Is it not for Christians? I said yes. I said yes. So what? Sometimes you find that some believers die very young and they are Christians. Twenty five, thirty five, thirty one, even fifteen. Twenty five, thirty five, thirty one, even fifteen. He said so. And he said, does it mean that God promises? I answered anyway. I said, what do you mean by long life? He said, long life, you know, what means for long life is that, you know, it's long life. He said, you know what I mean, sir. You want to live long. You want to live long. Something like that. I said, but Jesus never lived long. He said, that is a definition for long life. He said, no, no, that's what Jesus is special. That's what Jesus is special. I said, what can be more special? It has to do with God's promises for long life. Only that the Son in whom He is well pleased. And what was God's testimony about Jesus? He said, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye Him. I said, that promise, that promise, what do you think it should apply to more? And I said, I'm confused. And I said something. I said, yes. God promises for long life is for the believers. But please understand long life in terms of God's eternal purpose and plan. At the point in which our purpose expires. Then we don't have the gain of the body. So our purpose determines how long or how short we stay. The purpose of God's our life determines how long or how short. And it is important for us to know that the purpose of God can by no means be interrupted. You know what that means? You know what that means? What it means is that the Bible says by two things in which it is impossible for God to lie. What are the two things? What are the two things? What are the two things? Because how did God come to our life? We don't know what it is in the Bible. In which it is impossible for God to lie. God wants him to show the hair of promise. That his counsel for their life cannot be altered. This I still told you that must not leave you. I won't give you the homework. I won't tell you where it is. Go and look for it. But I won't quote it. He said, God made a promise. Eh? And he also confirmed it with a hope. Having nothing greater which he can swear. He swore by himself. That his counsel for our life can never be altered. What it means is that your days go to fulfill. God has committed himself to fulfilling your days. What that implies is that until you are true with the purpose of God, nothing can kill you. It is not death that kills. It is not sickness that kills. It is not accident that kills. There are just means. There are not the killer. These are things you must realize. There are not, that's why if some people go in accident. They'll say the cash I must have paid three hundred times. They will come out on scratch. I've not said that before. Somebody is, hey there. He's ok that caused me to pass this month. The person is before the coming of the person is dead. Some don't know any time to sickness. So when they were entering into sickness, they came through factored sickness For six months, after some time they would come out again and they would be alive. Have you not seen such before? And some they say just like that. Just like that they go. Before they could do anything, the person is dead. If the point I am making is that, we don't need to fear all these instruments or means that we should die. They are not a thing. God said that are not two sparrows soothed for how much? Soothed for how much? Soothed for how much? Eternally. Two sparrows, they are soothed for eternity. He said yes, one does not fall to the ground, eh, because of the consent of your father. He said fear not, you want more than. Amen. How many sparrows? How many sparrows? You want more than many sparrows. You know what he is trying to say? He said two sparrows, they are soothed for one penny. What does that imply? What does that imply? Two sparrows, there is no value placed on one. You have to bring two for it to have the lowest monetary value. Yet, one don't fall to the ground without God. Without God's consent. That is even what men don't value, cannot die, except God want it to die. How much more human life that has value? How much more human life that has value? He said so think. He said fear not, you want more than many sparrows. Say it with the L off your head. See these are things, if all of these give us promise, give us assurance that we don't need to fear death. But we need to be certain that death will come when it will come. However, we have an assurance as Christians that until my poverty subsides, I cannot die. And I am telling you, if your work with God is indeed a work with God, eh? Somehow, somehow, as your day draws near, eh? It will start getting clear. Even though you don't know which day is actual. It's just like the coming of the Lord. Do we know the actual day? Do we know the actual day? But, will it take us by surprise? It will not take us by surprise. All this Omba lawa soma, Omba biyo le loru, Omba o ferede. It's not talking to Christians. I hope you know. Are you aware that it's not talking to Christians? Some of us are not answering. Who is not aware it's not talking to Christians? You are not answering. He says, the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night. For when day shall say, peace and security? Suddenly the thief shall come upon them all of a sudden. He says, but to you, you are not of the night, that that day shall take you unawares. We don't know the exact day. But if the coming of the Lord takes you by surprise, you will not be raptured. As the day draws nearer, if you are truly working with the Lord, he exhalses unto you according unto yourself, sarman shiye. So they come towards you. And as they come towards you, he says unto you, Sarman sh Bengal kreepa, Surely I shall beers, alo Allah, remove every debris the lord is coming the lord is coming it was not the problem weekend that she left certain things cannot just take you unaware let's deepen our walk with the lord let's move in let's move closer let's let's draw in don't let us be something artificial christianity you know christians let's have the christians of death christians that dig inside that go inside the bombardment from the world and the push from the world is drawing us to be at surface people at least say today how deep are you digging people ask you more how are you making it what are you doing now what of your phd the world is drawing you more to things that are external i'm not saying these things are on themselves wrong but the believers should understand that where our kingdom does not belong here as much as we need this thing they are just means to an end for us they are not ending themselves and so beyond all of these things we draw we draw there are something more valuable do you know that everybody has been able to be careless do you know that huh but the wisdom is this our carelessness shows up over things that are priceless in our lives do i take that again everybody has a tendency to be careless we all are getting together a bag it doesn't matter But what I want you to sit down and understand is that our carelessness, the madness, the show-off, over things and in areas, things that are priceless in our life, things that don't have value, things that are not precious. When something is precious to you, your careless traits will not show up. You will be diligent with it. You will be careful with it. When you see yourself being casual with certain things, it is because to you it has no value. Everybody has the tendency to be careless. But the wisdom is that, check man, what is careless with things? It is things that are wish. You have not put a price. If you have put a price on something, and say, wow, this price is matchless, this thing is, you will notice. Look at the way some of you handle your phones, your android phones. You always wanted to be with you. You always wanted, where is my phone? It is because. But check, you may not be doing like that if you are viral. All I am saying is that. All I am saying is that. All I am saying is that. Outside the world, our environment is not pushing us to go deeper and deeper and deeper in the Lord. It is more selfish and artificial. But let us understand that we only occupy this thing. That people are putting so much of their energy on for just a while. I have not this body. I only live inside it. When this body drops, what you see is just my remains. It is not me. I have moved ahead. I will have to leave this body. So this body is not the focus. I will have to leave it. I will transcend it. I am an eternal being. That is the reality under which we should live. We are not mortal beings. It is this body that is mortal. We are eternal. We cannot die. We shall live. See. This body has died. Look at him. He is not him. He only left that tent. And he will be there just for a while. He will die. But the way the world is arranged, we have placed so much, you know, much less pride on that tent that the thought of living is terrifying us. Because all our investment is in it. It is on the tent. And it is in the tent. It is not on ourselves. Invest into yourself. Not into this tent. Invest beyond the tent. Because the tent is just a footfall. Not God will eat it. But after you have transcended out of this tent, that is the reality. What have you invested into yourself? Who are you outside this tent? If you pull down this tent, and then we drop the certificates, we drop marriage, we drop children, we came here naked. We are going to go back naked. After we drop all of them, who are you? We don't demand that we use this body as a means to an end. Because we will drop it. That is the essence of it. It is a sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire. But a body, as thou prepared me. It is not a prepared thing to serve God. It is not the primary thing you use it for. Oh, you are an unfortunate person. It was just prepared. It was given you for service. While you are here. Primary purpose of life. And that is why, Herodotus says something. He says, Help. What is the conclusion? Fear God and keep His command. For what? This is the whole duty of man. Man don't have any other duty. As I am pursuing my third degree, it is not with the fear of God, I am a fool. I can pass chemistry 101 by cheating. Then I am a moron. My duty is not to get chemistry 101, it is to fear God. And you understand what I am trying to say? Even if I am living my life, I am trying to get a job, I am lying to get it. I am a fool. My duty is not to get a job. My duty is to fear God. So as I am getting the job, I am asking myself, is it in the fear of God? If I am calling around to get sisters, because I want to marry. Then I am not wise. Because my duty is not to marry, my duty is to fear God. If in getting the wife, will I fear God? Achieving and getting and obtaining, our duty is to fear the Lord. That is our whole duty. That is our whole duty. And so, as the calendar changes again from 16 to 17, it is important for us to get something clear. If the purpose of God had expired in 2016, I would not have been here. I would not have been here. I would not have been here. In 2017. Do you get the point I am making? If God brings me into 17, it is because of what? There is still something to be done for me. The purpose can finish in 17 and it may change again into 18. But the focus is not talking of time, time, time. It is focusing on the purpose. To understand it. To know it. To follow it. The more you understand it, the more you know how much time you have left. Do you understand it now? Eh? Do you understand it? Do you know that as he was pursuing that purpose, he said, look, my food, my meat is to do what? To do what God has sent me. And to do what? And to finish it. No, not it. As he was moving on, he was moving on. And the purpose was expiring. Eh? Was he not clear to him? Was he not clear to him? It was prayer. As on that day, prayer, he said, look, the person who betrayed me is coming. The purpose is getting over gradually. He said, look, the son of man will deliver to sinners and they are going to kill him. And eventually, he was delivered. He knew that that time he got to Pilate and they are going around the judgment. And they are turning it. And they are turning it. But Jesus expecting that. Eh? The judgment will turn for justification. He wasn't expecting it. He knows that even though he is going to be in justice, we can never prove it. So it is not perturbing. He submitted to it. He said, ah, but that is only about Jesus. It is not true. Let me show you some other men. When Jacob was about, I want to take you back to ever before grace appeared. When Jacob was about to die, they did not know. He called his sons. He said, come, let me tell you what happened the last day. And when he finished blessing them, what did he do? Eh? He gathered himself together and he left. But what I want to show you about Jacob, eh? Is that no matter how scattered your life is, eh? You can still walk with God. He was a very scattered man. Eh? He jacobbed his brother. He jacobbed his father. He jacobbed Laban. He jacobbed Laban too. Jacob jacobbed him. Eh? But even at the end of the day, eh? That man Jacob was made Israel. And as a prince, he prayed with God. So, it doesn't matter how scattered. That is why I believe in people. I believe so much in people. I believe there is no land that God cannot put together. You know. But look at how it went. Leave that man Let's come again to the New Testament. What did Paul say towards the end? He said, in fact, at a point, he said, ah! I long to be away from this body. Did you do that about him? Eh? He said, and that would have been better. He said, but for your sake, ah! He said, if I stay here, I'll be able to teach you more. He said, so what would I do now? Do I tell God that I should be coming or because of you I should wait? I don't care if people are dealing with death. Death that we are! People talk about death when they are with Christians. I want to see how men who work with God handle death. If you say, who should I choose then? Who should I choose? Eh? If God gives you an offer, who should you choose? Who should I choose? Well brethren, let me tell you with today's Christianity, the kinds of things that we are doing today with Christianity, when we are not made to see our whole duty, it looks like we have got that duty apart from our whole duty. Is that what you are saying? Okay, let us pray now. Not my head, not my blood. I must say, it's not a wrong thing to pray. For God to preserve us. He asks us to ask or else we will not receive. Is that not true? So it's not a wrong thing. So the prayer is not a wrong thing. Don't get me wrong. We pray them because we are asked to pray. But what I'm asking is that look at the intensity, the tenacity, the spirit, the fervency. We say that prayer is praise. But when you tell men, pray, so that we can understand the ways of God. Father in the name of Jesus, Amen. Okay, move on, buddy, move on, move on. Tell us. I want to pray and you tell me. Father in the name of Jesus, I want you to understand your purpose in the name of Jesus. Let me understand it. But you say, pray then. The television that somebody will die. Now we need to pray that somebody will die. Check whether people will take phone. You will say, hey! Father! Mama! Mama! Mama! Take it! Holy God! You will see that kind of thing. So it is not the prayer that is my problem. I'm only saying that we become negligent and careless. Eh? We become negligent. We become careless. Eh? Over things. Eh? That we don't value. That is why the prayer can be, Father, I want to know you in the name of Jesus. Eh? Okay. It's just interacting with your phone. You will become careless. You will become negligent. Because the price on it is enormous. Is that what I'm trying to draw? But not to criticize the need for salvation. I hope you get the point I'm making. What I'm really thinking of, what's your attitude? What's your intensity? What's the thing you pursue? See how you pursue them! Eh? You will know what actually you worship. The point I'm making is that, as we pick again from 15 to 17, I want to just announce to you, that's what I told them two on Monday in executive class, that the Lord is saying, eh? If your purpose has expired in 15, there will be no need to bring you into 17. It is not because you did not live long, but because your purpose has expired. But if you are crossing to 17, it's because the purpose still remains. That's the way to look at life. And that's the correct way to see it. That's the correct way to see it. In 15, to how will you feel? It is important to know, just like the Buddha said, it's about our salvation. Jesus actually died to give us eternal life. He didn't die to give us mortal life. You didn't obtain salvation for your mortal life. You obtained for us eternal life. See, for God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son. That whosoever believes in Him will not perish. If we have eternal life, there will be no need for Jesus to die. What I mean is that ever before He came, men have been rich. And men have not been rich. Ever before He came, men have been living for 120. Go and live for 939. Is that not true? Eh? Men have been living for 120, 140, 150. Men have been marrying. They have been giving back. They have been going to school. Is that not true? But God gave His Son Eh? To men who have all of this before. They have all those things. But with all those things, there was no work. There was no life. What was bothering God about man? It's not that man was not rich. It's not that man was not educated. It's not that man was not marrying. It's not that man was not spending calendar days. That was not what was bothering God. What made God to do that thing that you know we call we call immeasurable immeasurable love. What made God to go through a death so gruesome. What made God go through all of this suffering and all of those things was not because was not because I want to have this too. Was not because men don't have mortal life. Is that not true? Men have mortal life. They have been married. They have been living for 20, for 300 years. For 950 years. For all those things. Only for almost 1000. All of those things were going on. But yet God saw that these ones they are what? They are perishable. God has to take respect. In spite of all those things the life of man was vacant. It was nothing. And so God took a step. Give what? Eternal life. It is important for us to realize. I am not saying just something very basic. What I am talking about is something very big. Eh? It's just a basic basic cause. Jesus died to give all the investment of God is that you may have eternal life. The life of praying and it was like you know blood dropping out of his body and they were saying Father is it possible? Is it possible to escape it? And God said no no no this is the only way we can give them eternal life. He said okay not my will. Your will be done. I have to go through okay? And he submitted to that kind of death in that manner all God was thinking about was eternal life. It is not because you don't have other kind of life. Because men have been having, men have always had the other one. They have always had it. They have always had it. Have they not always had it? They have always had it. I want to check it very well. Look around you today. Eh? The richest eh? They are the holiest. Look around you today. The richest are the holiest. The most educated. Eh? The most educated. Eh? Are the ones who work with God the surprised? Most. Can we donate that now to our nation? Who is the richest among us? In our own nation? Who among us have been termed among the richest in our own nation? Eh? In our own nation. Can we name some of them? Zangote? Any other one you think that we know? Okay. Just one person is the richest. These are just one person. He has no contemporary. He has nobody that he is. No rival. No rival. Okay. My question is this. Okay. Is that an advocacy? But he is still in Nigeria. Okay. Let's look at our own Nigeria. Eh? How do you describe him? In terms of your Christian faith. How do you describe him? The point I am trying to bring out is that he didn't need Jesus to get that one. He didn't need Jesus to get it. So why do you think you need Jesus to get it? Why are you thinking that way? Don't let people fool you. People need Jesus to get that. That is not why Jesus died. You can get that without Jesus. Those things Eh? They are just what you call gifts of providence. God makes it Eh? creations. They are just creation and gifts. So whether you fear God or you don't fear God as long as you work hard you do this, you will get that. You don't need Jesus for it. You must understand that actually God loves his creation. He is a God of love. He made it to reign upon both the wicked and the good. You must get this to his prayer. To even the wicked. You can't say, God I need a wife. And the children will do well. Have you not seen first thing before? Ah! You are thinking of doing well, doing well. That is why you are thinking of Jesus. Then you are a fool. All those things have been before Jesus went to the cross. I am trying to show you what you need Jesus for and what you don't need Jesus for. I am trying to show you how will you feel that. What happened along the line I really don't know. The essence of Jesus now is to make money. The essence of Jesus now is to be most educated. The essence of Jesus now is to be shifted. I did not know. But I am only showing you. You know I am taking time to do your devotion very well so that God can make way for you. Even if you don't do it well you will see that. There are people who say, God! There is no God. All of them. They have not been graduating. So what are you saying? Don't do your devotion. Don't do anything. You will still pass. God gives people both the wicked and the good. So that is why you are doing your devotion. You are praying, I want to be in fellowship so that God can make way for me. You are a fool. You are a fool. There are higher things to pursue with Jesus. There are higher things to pursue with Jesus. There are higher things. That is what I am trying to make you remember. Suddenly we forgot. We forgot how we received. We are forgetting how we received. There is a need to remind ourselves again of how we received. So you don't think that you know, God is somewhere carrying a tree, carrying a stick in his hand. You, okay, you didn't like the way I came today. Okay you, I will make sure you come out with a cup of coffee. You are thinking about God and you are following God. Please forget it all. If you leave God, He can still give you a plan. Because He is giving it to those who don't. He gave it to rain upon both the good and the wicked. He does not. He is hoping that everybody will make his way. He does not. Whether you don't do it or you do it, that is not why Jesus went to the cross. He went to the cross to give eternal life. Anybody is not truly following Him. What the person will not have is eternal life. Is not mortal life. You have mortal life. If you carry your book, read Jesus, carry your book, read very well, do all the tests, get there, you will pass. So don't think that is why you are pursuing God. You should get this very very clear. Rather, what I need Jesus for, eh, is this academics that I want to do. I would like to do it in the way that is God's way. In the way that is holy and upright and in the love of God. That is what you need Jesus for. But if you forget the A and the B, it is not about Jesus primarily. That is a God factor. It is a providential gift. It is a providential. You should understand this thing. I am saying that Jesus died to make us godly. To raise a people to himself. A peculiar people that says, no to ungodliness. That says no to worldly love. You don't need Jesus to get a wife. But you need Jesus that when you are dating, it is pure and it is holy. That is what you need Jesus for. But if you marry a lady, you don't need Jesus. It is a providential gift. I don't believe that they don't marry. But what is the difference then? It is not in holiness. It is not in righteousness. It is in the purity of man, which is to fear God. That is the difference. When I enter into the fellowship today, you see what I mean? We are following Jesus as in everything. I don't see a different relationship from what we find among unbelievers. They will know this one. They don't know Jesus. They don't understand the essence of Jesus. You always get a lady to marry without Jesus. The reason why you are a follower of Jesus is because the relationship went. You will see the fear of God. That is the only difference. It is only Jesus to have children. The only difference we will see is that we will see that these children, they are for signs, they are for wonders. That is the only difference. I am showing you living beyond the mortal life. Living beyond the mortal life. We have reduced the essence of Jesus to what? To what? To having mortal life. And I saw the Lord ringing again in my spirit. It is not because of mortal life that God brings you into 20th century. If your purpose had expired in 20th century, you would not have entered 20th century. There has eternal purpose and God is using the possibility of that purpose being carried out. If you think that this thing can still be done, there is still time for the purpose. And when you are talking about giving a parable of the gardener, who was taking care of a vine and the other came and did not see fruit on it he threw it away. Let us wait. Let us wait. Why is it cumbering the ground? Why is it just there? Why is it just existing? Why is it just mortal life? Talk it up with not doing the eternal one. Please wait. Wait. Let me put my nail again around it. Let me see what if I put my nail if I do everything it will bear the fruit. It is ok. Let us give it another one year. The reason why God preserves life is because he has purpose. Don't think because you prayed you did this, you did that. No. That is not the issue. And if you don't realize that there is no reason why you should be preserved. It is about his purpose. It is about keying into it. It is about entering into it. It is about following. It is about understanding it. That is what we need Jesus for. The Bible says that Jesus has broken the wall of partition that separates between us and him. He took away the unlimited error so that God and man can be one they can talk again and can say God ok so what to do? Ok leave this one. Take the essence of Jesus. He came to break the wall of partition. He said being justified by faith we now have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. He said through him we have gained access into this grace wherein we stand. He said by a new and a living way he has given us a new and a living way to live. He has made what? A new way for us. Through what? Through his blood. So that having turned this way that is separating us from God we can have access unto him. That is what we need Jesus for. The grace of Jesus. That is why he says take while you are tenaciously doing anything so that you can live mortal life. It is so unfortunate. That is why several believers appear as men and who have eternal life because they have reduced eternal life to water to mortal life. As long as they have A in chemistry A in theory A in that God is good He has done good. Even if you don't have God if you are having A you will realize that too. I am saying is that that heaven rejoices that a man built a new house that he bought a car Have you ever heard such rejoicing before? Have you ever heard one? And then the heaven opens and God was pleased because somebody has a class Do you know why God does not give these things? Because they are providential gifts We don't need to be in fellowship with God to have these things. People want his enemies He is so forgiving them He is not giving his enemies What is better that you have done for him is that he wants to rejoice over that you are his child Then he makes a class His enemies have that too I have children and so what? His enemies Do this All of them Are they not having children? Are they not having love life? Are they not up to par? Are they not seeing them? So that they give him more So that he live for one or two years And do not see them So that he live for one or two years You see my God is so great That is looking like they don't want God to rejoice over Because even when he is earning he also have those things That God does not show you The joy of a Christian, if that is your core joy, then so unfortunate. That's not the core joy. The core joy of a Christian is that, bro, do you know that I'm growing in godliness? Do you know that now I can hear God better? Do you know that I was able to preach and somebody got born again? That is the core joy of a believer. Do you know that, that, you know, there was this brother that was not living well. And, you know, as I speak, the Lord gave me an insight into it. That fellowship with him. And I went to meet him. And we discussed it. And he confessed to it. And today it restores. That is the joy of a Christian. That is what's on our core joy. That is that we have eternal life. Our joy is not that we have mortal life. Our joy is not that we have mortal life. Our joy is not that we have mortal life. It's not the core of our, it's not the core of our joy. We are happy if we have them because they are good. But this is not our joy. The devil will never see the Bible and say, devil, the joy is that somebody built a house or buy a car. But it is that there is joy in heaven. Over water. Over one's food. That tells you the focus of God. When eternal life is on. That is the kingdom of God is not in eating and in drinking. Do you know that we should not eat and drink? Do you know that we should not eat and drink? Don't we eat and we drink? Because we need to take care of the body. But this kingdom is not in it. So don't think I'm saying that, eh, when you get to school, don't read your book again. Don't show away your book. The exact, you don't know what I'm saying. I left my department as the best student from my department. God so willing, I should be truth my PhD this year. I'm not willing for my external defense. So for you to know that, I'm educated. For you to understand that, I'm saying that this is not our God. Eh, who don't know God? Eh? I'm top class PhD. So that's it. I didn't I didn't. See, everybody is now rejoicing. Hey, my son now PhD. So why God will rejoice? God, why our God will check it? Did he tell lies? In writing the final thing? Did you, did he write anything that he did not do in defeat? Look at the one God wants to check that will give him joy. That it was a pain. By godliness and uprightness. Ah, you, you, you got the old duty. I was recognized. That is the one that God rejoices over. But are you glad to hear that God is not going to forget about it? That's not his job. That's not it. Let us remember how we receive. What we receive was eternal, eternal life. For God so loved the world. That he gave his only begotten son. That whosoever believe in him should not perish but have eternal life. That is what we received. That is what we got. There was nothing more that we received apart from this.\"}\n",

Let us have a word of prayer. Then we'll introduce our topic for today and look at some backgrounds.

To do the work of edification, the work of building, the work of grace, the work of molding. O God, let it please you to walk in our midst. Thank you, eternal Father. Blessed be your holy name. In Jesus' name, we praise. Amen. Amen. We are looking like just in line with the message I sent across yesterday. We are looking at Lessons from the Fig Tree. Lessons from the Fig Tree. The story of the Fig Tree is in Matthew 21 and Mark chapter 11. Lessons from the Fig Tree. Lessons from the Fig Tree was a topic we started on Monday. Well, oh, sorry, we started last month, St. Goose Club. Last month, St. Goose Club, on a Saturday, we started this Lessons from the Fig Tree. That's when it started. And I will just try to go back and read, read again the text. The text. The text. The text. Matthew 19. Just to refresh our memory on one or two things, and then we now move on to the concluding part of that topic today. In Matthew 21, we have the story, why the fuller story is in Mark chapter 11. Matthew 21. The story began from verse 18. It says, now in the morning, as he returned to the city, Jesus was returning back to Jerusalem. He arrived in Jerusalem the previous day. He was in the temple where he said, my house will be called the house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers. And then, he went to Bethany. So, he was returning back to Jerusalem that morning. So, the fifth tree was located between Bethany and Jerusalem. As he was returning that morning, the Bible says that as he returned, he was hungry. And seeing a fifth tree by the road, he came to eat and found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, let no fruit grow on you again. Let no fruit grow on you ever again. Immediately, the fifth tree withered away. We have the fuller story in the Mark version of that, of that apple. In Mark 11, the story is fuller. We got more. More information. When you read it in the Mark, in the Mark gospel, in Mark 11, you see it from verse 12. It says, now the next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry. And seeing a fifth tree afar, had he lived. He went to see if perhaps he would find something on it. He came to eat. He found nothing but leaves. For it was not the season for food. In response, Jesus said to it, let no man eat from you ever again. And the disciples heard it. So, in the month of November, we're looking at the fig. And then, we read some fundamental lessons, which was the first part of the lesson. That is, the first part of the lesson was based on, when the Lord came close to eat, it was full of leaves. There was no fruit. There were no fruit. There was no fruit on it. And we were asking ourselves in the month of November, how do we look at your life? How do you look at from afar? Does it look like, when people look at you from afar, people will feel that there is fruit in your life. But actually, you are full of leaves. Just leaves. And then, we did not try to expand that matter in the month of November. In expanding the matter, we made it clear that, number one, it is crucial for you to know that, ordinarily, there is nothing wrong with eating. There is nothing wrong with eating leaves. But a lot of things are wrong if leaves don't lead to fruit. And we took time to explain what leaves can represent in the life of the believer. Particularly, we mentioned that it represents the gift of the Spirit. Huh? The gift of the Spirit. Huh? The gift of the Spirit. Huh? It represents that somebody is alive. If somebody is not alive, it cannot bring forth leaves. When you plant something, huh, the first thing is that it will, the sign of growth, outside, you go down. When you plant a seed, it grows downwards for the roots, and also grows upward. Now, how will we know that it is growing downward is that leaf that comes out upward. So, we said ordinarily to be born again, to have spiritual gift, it's not as if it is bad. But, there is everything wrong about a life that is not full of gift and have no fruit. Then we took time to expand the matter of the fruits of the Spirit. We went to the church in Corinth, Paul, Paul appreciated that church for not coming behind in any gifts. But, he later told them that he cannot address them as Purishwa, they are merely cana. Because, they could not manifest the fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit. There were no fruits in their life. They have utterance, they have prophecy, they have the gift of preaching, they have all of other things. But, when you check, anger, division, malice, impatience, envy, backbiting, that was one thing that church. Selfishness. The church was full of confusion and disappointment. Then we took reopening for Christian life. Jesus came to this world. And He revealed the Lord because He told us as Christians have faith in Christ. He revealed the body of Christ. If you pray for the body of Christ to come into anyone. If you pray for the body of Christ to come into the conference, then that body of Christ to come into the conference. If you pray all the house, if you pray for the whole church. You will Studienied and seriam Iím not talking about religion. You will be told the signs are there, relations are there. You will be told characters. The words are there, to whom you are тебе speaking sends scenes. is not leaf, you sign of majority is fruit. When the plant target in mutual, you begin to see fruit. So, when you see a life that is full of fruit and gift of the Spirit, manifestations, prophecy, preaching, teaching, the world, usherance, all of that, and you find that it's what you can gather in that life, We announce in the month of November It is just a sign that you are a babe It is just a sign that you cannot go very far It is just a sign that you have not gone anywhere yet Real things have not begun with your life Because what the Lord is looking for is not live What the Lord is looking for is food What the Lord sought What the Lord is looking for in a man's life is food The leaves are not enough The leaves are not enough So, why the leaves are not bad in the tree But we sounded very clearly In the month of November That the leaves are not enough The leaves are not the things we need We need more than the leaves Huh? And in closing in November We also noted that What led to this topic actually Was because as my wife and my husband We counseled with couples Particularly younger couples Younger marriages Counseling with them Relating to them Dealing with them And so We began to realize That one of the major Fundamental problems In causing marital instability In Christian marriages today Is that People get attracted to each other Just like the Lord got attracted to that food On the basis of the leaves Huh? What attracted the Lord to the food Was the leaves But what the Lord needs to satisfy him Was fruit So we said Many times people People because of their giftings They get attracted to each other The young man is handsome The young man is purposeful He has a good career He is intelligent He is a believer He was one time the president of fellowship He speaks in tongues He is this He is prayerful You just look at all the You know The giftings of the person And people settle down in marriage But unfortunately Huh? What actually we need to run a home Is not just spiritual gift Eh? The gifts cannot run a home What you need in a home Are the things that You know We mentioned In Galatians chapter 5 Eh? That was how we concluded in November In Galatians chapter 5 Galatians chapter 5 I said What we need to run a home Is not just the fruit Is not just the The The The gifts Huh? And I read Galatians chapter 5 That day In drawing a conclusion I said Galatians chapter 5 verse 16 I said there Walk in the spirit And do not prefer the lust of the flesh For the flesh lusts against the spirit And the spirit against the flesh And these are contrary one to another So that you do not You You do not do the things That you wish But if you are led by the spirit You are not under the law Now the works of the flesh are evident Which are adultery Huh? Fornication Huh? You see people in marriage today In their relationship See having intimate relationship with their exes See becoming more intimate with one of their friends One of one female friend They are not intimate with their spouse Huh? They don't seek to be intimate with their spouse Eh? These are works of the flesh Uncleanness Neatness Idolatry Sorcery Hatred You see Hatred in marriages Bitterness Contentions You see You see You see You see spouses Contending with each other Over money Over sex Over this Over interest Eh? This is my own That is not your own You spoke like this You do speak like that You seek contention You seek jealousy Eh? Someone You see You see jealousy Eh? Some man Jealous of their wife's progress Some wife Jealous About You know Did you see All this kind of You know Negativities In Christian marriages And you be wondering Are these no believers? Yes they were believers But unfortunately Eh? What accumulated in their lives Were leaves Leaves They were full of the gifts of the Spirit There was no fruit And so Attraction comes On that baby Eh? You know When you look at his head Jealousy Outbursts of anger You see today Christian marriages These are works of the flesh These are works of the flesh Selfish ambition Eh? One person wants to You know As long as My own thing Is not done The marriage is not done The marriage is not done The marriage is not done The marriage is not done The marriage is not done The marriage is not done Eh? The marriage is not done The marriage is not done If you don't do it My own way Then there will be no peace In this house Eh? Selfish ambition Eh? Dissension Heresy You see You see spouses Saying things That are not Biblical Things that the Lord Never said About marriage If you look Look Look me Me I don't believe in Eh I cannot divorce So I will throw you out Of this marriage If you are not careful The utterance The utterance is That That That are heretical You see Envy Murder Is that not happening today Christian marriages Spouses killing themselves Eh? Drunkenness Rivalry And delight This I tell you before hand Just as I do Just as I told you In time past That those Who practice such things Will not inherit The kingdom of God Yes You may be a brother You may be a sister Yes Or an elder You may be an elder In this life I am just a brother I will be a sister I will go a different way To this life I will go a different way Where I have gone From being a brother To becoming a sister To becoming aBL I will go a different way I will be a son To become a daughter To become a daughter To become a father To become a father So Little one Little one A boy Better than a girl A face A face A face Good Like Goes Marriages are contracted on the basis of leads. People are attracted to themselves on the basis of leads. But that cannot run marriages. Young man, young woman listening to me. The purpose of single's club is capacity building. Begin to build capacity for your life. Begin to know what is wrong. Begin to do what is right. Begin to build so that you don't become a failure in time to come. Huh? We are saying this because we are seeing it so much. You will agree with me today that Christian marriages, many Christian marriages are not happy marriages. I'm not showing you one of the fundamental rules. It's that the works of the flesh, you know, is what you find in the life of the brother and what you find in the life of the sister. Is it because they are not Christians? No, they are. But they don't understand. There is a difference between the gift of the spirit and the fruit of the spirit. Huh? Belief only tells us that, yes, this person is born again, oh, this person is alive, oh, he encounters Christ, oh, good, this person has gifts, he has that, he has this, he has that, he is coming up, huh, but that is not a sign of maturity, it's not a sign of becoming like Jesus, huh, a man's gift does not tell you the level of his maturity. It is the fruit of a man. It is the fruit of a man. So people enter into a marriage gift today not spiritually prepared. They are financially prepared, huh, but psychologically, mentally, and spiritually, they are not prepared. And that is the most critical preparation for a man. For a man is a spirit. Man is a spirit. And when you get into the thing, you have not married a man. I mean, you have not married somebody who is spiritual. You have not married somebody who is a full human being. You start seeing all kinds of animalistic tendencies, outbursts of anger, envy, jealousy, cruelty, impatience, selfishness. It's about the fruit of the spirit. It's what? Love. Are you seeing it? My husband don't love me. My wife don't love me. Huh? All what you thought was love initially were just lies. Because if you people have not talked about love and initially said you wouldn't have married one another, you will never have a husband. But if after a year or two you don't imagine, I say there is no love, it is what you saw before was lie. The fruit of the spirit is love. It is joy. Peace. Love suffering. I believe you should suffer love. I can't take that again. I can't take that from him. I can't take that from her. People can do suffer love. Anybody wants to have time to manage to get the best out of his. Nobody wants to have time to manage to get the best out of his. Nobody wants to have time to manage to get the best out of his. Nobody wants to suffer in it. I'm talking about the fruit of the spirit. Kindness. Goodness. Sense to the wife. A wife. Sense to the son in the husband. Gentleness. Self control. Self control. People can't control themselves when they are hungry. People can't control themselves under slight provocation. People can't control themselves under slight provocation. Under slight mistake of a spouse. Under slight mistake of a spouse. They start barking like fire. They start barking like fire. You can't just have control. People lose control over their tongue. They start saying all kinds of things. Self control. You see I have said all of the different things we said in the month of November. But you see they are serious burden on my heart. They are very very serious burden on my heart. They are very very serious burden on my heart. And that is why I seems to be re-emphasizing them again. And that is why I seems to be re-emphasizing them again. them again because they are very very very serious body upon our heart what we are witnessing today among young people young couples young marriages it's not it's not something one is happy about it's not something that that this one enjoy ah please young man young woman take lessons from the field and understand that why leaves can attract it cannot sustain why leaves can attract it cannot sustain why leaves can attract they cannot sustain please your your gift is your your people talk today about packaging i mentioned now it's our focus for today and i want to begin with the matter of packaging packaging is something today that has overwhelmed our world and of course lately it seems to be overwhelming christianity when the lord looked at the fish tree from afar the fish tree was well packaged packaged enough to attract the lord and today there is so much things about packaging people are not real people are not real but you know uh packaging does not guarantee a content there are several things that may not look well packaged that will not receive there's anything in it i want you need to know why am i talking about this how am i beginning like this is that i want to show you the book of isaiah as you look at him from the fig leaf today the matter of and the lord costs the fig because you'll be wondering that the laws cost the fig that is the focus today and the focus last month was it was full of leaves and we have talked extensively about that and i think this morning again even if you have not if you were not with us last month i have summarized that again what we said last month the fig was full of leaves that was for the month of november for the month of december we are concerned with and the lord caused the fig uh it's a very serious thing that the lord caused defeat it's a very very serious thing and i was beginning with packaging packaging and i was saying that packaging does not guarantee correct content and be very very careful about packaging because it is not it is not a um um god's principle of working uh god works with the reality BNM let me tell you huh the truth is not concerned about packaging because many times the truth is not attractive let me tell you let me show you some things about the lord Nismah many times the things that are trying to get your attention are trying to get your attention I saw something in Isaiah that made me to say the things that I am saying that packaging is not fundamental with truth but packaging is the essence of deception. Packaging is not fundamental with truth. It may be packaged, it may not be packaged. But packaging is the essence of deception. Deception cannot work without packaging. But truth can work without adding any packaging. Truth can fulfill all its purpose. Truth can fulfill all its purpose. Look at Isaiah chapter 53. Let's say something together there. Look at how even the chapter opens about the Lord. It says, Who has believed our report? Who has believed our report? Unto whom and to whom is the arm of the Lord being revealed? For he will grow up before him as a tender plant. He is talking about the Lord Jesus. He will grow up before him as a tender plant. As a root out of a dry ground. And the next thing. He has no form or what? Comeliness. And when you see, what are you saying? There is no beauty that you should desire in. I'm trying to make you see that truth is not consigned with packaging. Packaging is not a fundamental consign of truth. Today our world is blinded by truth. How does it look? How does it appear? What does it have? What can you get? How does it talk? Which fellowship does it belong to? This I'm trying to make you see a fundamental work of error today. One thing about truth. The Lord was packaging the salvation of man. Eh? By the time he appeared. Eh? It does not affect the people as someone they should believe. How can the Messiah be born? Eh? Where sheep? Eh? Eh? Where cattle? All those things. Where they gather? How can the Messiah go out and be the son of one capital that is not popular? Eh? To make the whole thing very very bad. The announcement of his birth was not given to popular people. They were going to shepherds to be announcing. Is that where you are announcing? Eh? Is that the place to go and announce? Eh? You are supposed to go to the center stage of the city. Gabriel will stand to this side. Michael to the other side. And you will be singing. Eh? O come let us adore him. I do know. And the child is going to be coming from heaven. Fa, fa, fa, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la. You know, if he had come like that. Eh? And Josephine just come down. And thirty-five angels. Eh? One to this side. Some to the other side. Eh? Three of them. Eh? Are managing to carry his Bible. Eh? Five of them are following with chariots. Eh? Another one following him with, are you understanding me? Who will not follow such a man? For you now saw one boy. That is the son of a carpenter. And then they will say, which school did he even go? He did not even go to the university or something. And then he is coming to. I am trying to make you see that truth is not about packaging. Eh? Men that will get what is real. Eh? Are men who can discern. If you will enter into realities in your life. Be careful about packaging. Pray the Lord for discernment. Pray the Lord for people to discern. Pray the Lord. Eh? You will notice that why the kings of those days. The rulers. All of them. Eh? Why they missed what God was doing. Eh? You can see how the Bible describe. Eh? Men who were not even qualified. Even the men who were not qualified. Eh? ইদে দে মেন দা কেব, দা ব্রাক দিফ তো ই. এ? দে ঵ে আয় দা ঵াস্যি পাসো. আও মেন দা দে লোড দে লোড এর স্টা জেবা. People will return. All we are wearing. So, the people who ordinarily should have nothing to do with the convenance. Eh? The people that in the Old Testament God said they should have nothing to do with. Eh? As the wolves. Eh? We were able to design from afar. Eh? And look at the irony of the thing. Those who are sons and daughters. The Pharisees. The Pharisees. The Priests. The Levites. The Scribes. That will expect to be the ones to get it right. And are you not seeing it today? The so-called born again. The ones in fellowship. The ones that seem to be doing it here and there. That will be thinking we get it right in their marriage, in their home, in their life. They are the ones getting it wrong. When you look at the level of the level of the level of things happening today. Eh? When our young people settle down in marriage. When they settle down into society. When they settle down to start life. When you begin to wonder. When you begin to wonder. And you will see. That is when you will see people who you think that their marriage should not even work. I'm talking about unbelievers. You will see some of them who will not be receiving peace in their marriages than some of us who are believers. Why are these things like this? Eh? I'm talking to you today young man and young woman that is listening to me. Be careful about packaging. Packaging is not the way of God. Eh? Don't try to paint yourself to attract people. What is real? Don't try to paint yourself, paint yourself, paint yourself, paint yourself so that it can attract you to get it. That is the principle of deception. So if you are looking, if you are looking, if you are trying to take your life decision based on the principle of packaging that is overwhelming the world today, you are likely to miss it in life. Because truth don't operate that way. Truth don't operate, eh? With let me do something so that they can, they can affect me. Let me tell, because truth is to be accepted ordinarily. But truth is accepted by those who deserve truth. I pray, I pray, eh? For you young man, young woman listening to me, eh? Will you not be lacking in understanding in the name of Jesus? Eh, you will not miss your path. You will not miss your path in the name of Jesus. You will not, eh, you will not, you will not, you will not, you will not, you will not, you will not, you will not, you will not, you will not, you will not, you will not, you will not miss your path in the name of Jesus. Its an absolute Eh? So the first thing I'll say in our today's meeting is be careful about packaging. Be careful about packaging. It's a principle of the world, it's not a principle of truth. How do I read? I've shown you when the Bible talks about Jesus that we shall see him, there's no beauty to desire him. But look at deception. Look at deception. Genesis chapter 3. Look at deception. Now Genesis chapter 3 from verse 1. These are popular stories but I'm not showing you fundamental things about the working of deception and the working of truth. Why you must daily pray as a young man, build capacity for desirement. Please, build capacity for desirement. You need to be able to desire the things of God. So that as you take decisions in life, you'll be taking decisions that will eventually satisfy your desires. That will eventually meet your need and satisfy your desires. You will not run adrift. Now when you look at deception, Genesis chapter 3, I'll be doing from verse 1. It says, Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the seed which the Lord hath made. You see the first thing about the serpent? What did the Bible say? Eh? Cunning. Cunning. Cunning. How? It said to the woman, Our God indeed said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden. And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, You shall not eat it, nor shall you eat if you die. Then God hath said, You will not surely die. Are you seeing something? The real issue. The real issue. Eh? The real issue for Jesus was that he was hungry. That was what the fruit tree by its leaf could not satisfy. The real issue here is that if they eat it, they will die. That is the issue that was hidden away. The real issue about eating that thing, eating that thing is that they will die. He said, You will not die. So because the real thing that deception is, eh? It is always eating. Eh? Deception needs to package. It needs to package. Eh? It is like when you want to kill somebody. Or you want to kill it. If you throw the poison down, rats will not eat. So you must package it. You must put seeds around it. So that when the rat is coming. Eh? The rat will not want to kill the ones that are here. Eh? We went, we went, we looked for fish. Roasted fish. Even some of the, some of the people came who were tempted, they want to eat up the fish. I said, No. We want to use it for those things we want to kill. They will not put the poison inside. Why are we packaging? That is, I am telling you, that is the principle of deception. Packaging is not the principle of truth. So, the real thing was that they will die. So, it has to, that has to be eating. That has to be somewhere. They, he says, you will surely not die. For God knows that the day you eat it, of it, your eyes will be opened. So, what is he giving them? The packaging. Will their eyes not be opened? Of course, their eyes will be opened. You will be like God. Will they not be like God? They will be like God. Knowing good from evil. Will they not? They will be like that. But he did not package it. It was a cover up. That is why I keep telling believers, be careful. We don't, we are not, we are not of the world. We are not of the world. We are real. Sometimes we want to talk, we package. You see, you know what I mean? You want to dress, we package. What you don't have, you borrow. You create impression that you have. We, we, we, we are running with the same principles of the world. Eh? When we are cutting, we make odd chances. We make statements of things we will never be able to do. Don't worry, once we marry, all will be, look, I will, we say, we start talking like unbelievers. We don't, we don't say what we mean. And we don't mean what we say. And that's why you find that we are willing to take the money sometimes. You say, but you said. You remember you said. Me, me said that. No. That was that time. You see, we people, we are asking, we begin to package. So, you see, I am trying to make you see something about package. Because that was one fundamental lesson we, we, I want us to take in this, in this continuation of lessons from before. Be careful about packaging. The fish trail appeared so beautiful, so wonderful. You don't saw it afar. Say, wow, wow, let me go. That is packaging. That is packaging. Be careful about packaging. And look at what, look at what happened in that place. When the woman saw that the trail was good for food. And you said it. See, it is good. See, it will not kill you. There is no death in it. Your eyes will be opened. You want to begin to see what had been there all this while that she never saw. And that trail had not been there. She never saw that it was good for food. She had only seen it as death. And that was what it is. Look at it. But it was, there was packaging. Look at it very well. God was not deceiving you. Huh? Do you see? Don't you see the way it is shining? See, look at the color blue. Look at the way the color, eh? Look at that, it is magic trail. Oh, you see the, oh, you see, you are going to step up. You just try it. You are stepping up. You see stepping up. Can't you see the thing? See, and that's what we do today. Can't you see it? Eh? It's a medical doctor. It's the son of a pastor. He's working in a chair. He's responsible now. Look at the way he dress. Look at the way he comb his hair. He's looking like a gentleman. Is that not the things we do today when people are married? He attends deeper life fellowship. No, he's very, very, he's very, very, very popular in agricultural youth fellowship. In fact, he was the Bible substitute. He was regional coordinator for FU. You know he was. This is how, this, this is not where you design who a man is. And then you say, oh yeah, this thing is good for food. What has been dear death? It has to look like food. And it was pleasant to the eyes. I wonder where this pleasantness came from. Packaging. Eh? And a tree is not able to make one wise. Eh? She took of it and did what? She ate. She also gave to her husband and he ate. Then the eyes of them were both open and they knew that they were naked. Were they told they would be naked? Were they told they would die? I wanted to make you see that, you know, real things. Because God is real. Because God is true. Because God does not deceive. Eh? He has told that if you eat this thing you will die. Tell her. There's nothing to package, there's nothing to package about that. That is the reality of it. It's either you take it or what? Or you leave it. But when you begin to see that you are doing everything to make somebody think. To make somebody do. Then be careful. You may be operating on other principles. Huh? Be careful about packaging. Packaging today is the principle of the world. Eh? Packaging, in fact, packaging, if you come to the world of cosmetics, human fashion. Eh? It's all goodness. You, you, don't let others go into that. I'm not talking about packaging today. But I'm only telling you as a young man, as a young woman. Because this principle of packaging. Eh? Is operating seriously today. Eh? Evil. Eh? Among us. Don't forget what the Bible told us. Eh? It said, as there were false prophets among them, there will be false teachers among you. That will bring in damnable heresies. Eh? And many will follow. Eh? Their immoral ways. This principle of packaging, which used to be a principle of deception. Eh? Is now among us, even in fellowships. Is now among us in the things we do. We create impressions. We are deceitful. We say we are being wise. Eh? Little lies. Deception. Eh? They say, no, I know. You know, you just have to be diplomatic about it. You are telling lies. They say you are diplomatic. Eh? We tell lies. Eh? We are using the same principle of packaging. We are not sincere. We are not candid with people. Eh? We don't speak the truth. Act to answer them. When the Father is talking with you today. Eh? The sinner is speaking with you. Eh? Except you have discernment. You know that he's even planning to kill you. And both of you are in brah bruh. Do you see? Eh? And both of you are in brah bruh. Do you see? And both of you are in brah bruh. And both of you are in brah bruh. Do you see? And both of you are in brah bruh. Do you see? And both of you are in brah bruh. Do you see? And both of you are in brah bruh. Do you see? Somebody is telling you that don't worry. Eh? I am going to make sure all is well. He is only saying that because he just wants to get your attention. It's not as if he meant it in the sense. You see, all kinds of things like this today. Eh? You know, packaging has become a serious matter. Packaging, you know, has taken a dimension today among us. Eh? And it has become a caker worm that has eaten us. Eh? And it has become a caker worm that has eaten us. And it has become a caker worm that has eaten us. Eh? And you have the thought that we are all shipping so deeply, leaves everywhere. And you'll be thinking that there are full of fruits. Leaves. No fruits. But I keep saying and I keep demonstrating. Every time I talk about these things I keep demonstrating. Eh? People say it was the pleasure of this, pleasure of that that make that to happen. Eh? I also tell you that, and you agree with me, that when anything come under pleasure it is what is in the heart. It is what is in the heart. Don't think too much. Eh? So, you see, don't say too much. Do not say too much. It is so, it is so, it is so deep. You know. what is inside that we come out when we when we subject anything a bottle a plastic eh to pleasure and it feels god broken once we come out of it is what is inside it so many times pleasure don't make people what they are not it only brings out what is in them what you see in people like packaging and one thing we must feel from today if we must get it right as a people of god is to flee from packaging don't let us talk don't let us ask don't let us behave in a way that is not sincere young man young woman don't talk in a way don't ask in a way don't don't don't do things in a way that is not sincere be transparent be truthful don't face me that you are facing south these are the kinds of things you find today the principle of packaging but i'm only showing you that it is not the principle of god truth is so true truth is itself that is why when something is truthful and kind is when you first see it hey there will be no reason to even desire it that's what we saw it was just itself what he does not have he does not have what is not there is not there this is who i am may the lord help us but young man i'm only telling you something young man young woman listening to me wherever you are brethren or miss la telegram i'm pleading with you oh do everything to grow your capacity to design packaging is everywhere today in our churches and in our fellowship packaging is everywhere growing in disarming before you begin to take major decisions in life growing is oblative to design grow in it i'm telling you a response how do you6 register as a young man is what i'm showing you and i'm telling you you know this principle that packaging is not a new thing that's why it took you to wear génesis ever from the beginning of of of time packaging andimmung from the beginning of time packaging is not a new thing and look at what do a young man in his rich day is doing he will not give up and then he will pass away And look at how people responded to him. Look at how they responded. Huh? You remember Ahija, the prophet. Huh? I'm showing you how people have responded to packaging. Huh? Ahija was the prophet that anointed Jeroboam. Jeroboam that ten tribes went with. Two tribes went with Jeroboam. Ten tribes went with Jeroboam. That King Jeroboam, it was Ahija that told him what God will do. That God's going to tear the kingdom into two. He's going to give him ten tribes. Two tribes will remain with the seed of David. Eventually that came to pass. When it came to pass, Jeroboam grew. But unfortunately, he became wicked and idolatrous. At a point in his life, he wanted to connect back with Ahija. But he knew that Ahija would not listen to him. So you know what he did? Huh? He did packaging. He told his wife. Huh? He said, dress in another garment that will not make you appraised. Sister of Jeroboam. Huh? Go and meet Ahija. Huh? Ask for it. Huh? We need to know what God is saying now. But you know, if we go as we are, He will only rebuke us. Huh? He will not tell us what we need to do. You know he was the one that told us this. When men lost the retain, they lost the retain and they don't want to come again. Don't ask their sincerity to connect with the retain. connect with the reading they want to connect again with packaging and then he said grow anything and then the woman went what what did the Bible tell us us the Bible tells us that why she was still on the way the spirit of the Lord spoke to Aisha see this and this and this and this is what Jeruboam had decided and this and this and this is the way you should answer Jeruboam hey that is sending his wife and talk to the world you don't even know what you know the the the story hey do you know that as at the time as at the time when when um um um Jeroboam sent to Aisha the Bible says if Aisha have gone very old that physically he could not see he was a blind man he was no more seen again physically huh and so when but however when Jeroboam's wife entered into the house of Aisha okay the Bible says Aisha said we're called that wife of Jeroboam why are you discussing yourself eh to appear like another woman anyway this is what the Lord has to tell you do you see how people are responding to packaging that is growing growing in design packaging have always been from time immemorial packaging from time immemorial I want to see if I if I could quickly pick that story so that we read it together that is first Kings chapter 14. I don't want you to see that reading first Kings chapter 14. let's see that reading you know it's just something for us to learn from something for us to see and know because you can see that there is nothing new under the source oh it's from the story begins from verse one at that time Abigail became sick and Jeroboam said to his wife please arise and disguise yourself that first Kings chapter 14 from verse one first King okay you please please arise disguise yourself okay that you may not be that they may not recognize you are the wife of Jeroboam go to Shiloh indeed I got the property there who told me that I will be king over this people also take with you 10 loaves some cake and a jar of honey go to him it will tell you what will become of the child I grew by white ditso she arose and went to Shiloh and came of Aida but Aida could not see for his eyes were glazed by reason of his of his age now the lord has said to Aida here is the wife of Jeroboam coming to ask you something about his son about her son for you seek doth and doth shall you say to her for it will be when she comes in that she will pretend to be another woman and so it was when Aida hear the sound of her footsteps as he came through the door he said he said come in wife of Jeroboam why do you pretend to be another person for i have been sent to you with bad news go tell your husband are you saying something what capacity are you building today for your whole life how will you be able to respond to packaging deception that is everywhere today if you don't build capacity as a young man this capacity how do i respond to packaging this capacity lesson from defeat the lord caused defeat let's go i believe i've been able to twist the first major lesson our world is a world of packaging and be careful not to go in that path packaging is not the part of truth is the part of deception don't go in that path how do you respond to packaging develop and success yes in some places paper books the political group broke down now because i was a black and they began to fight in people's lost rights to nuestras rights and yeah today we go around the world from the briefing meetings say principles to thank god to the boy the boy a family has no hatred at all that God's calling us pray and do spiritual work brother the air is flowing well in my life brother and his son has no pain i have much trouble with his and seeing afar a fig tree having leaves, he went to see if perhaps he would find something on it. When he came to eat, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not deceiving for fig. In response, Jesus said to eat, let no man eat from you ever again, and his disciples heard it. Now, when you look at this story, what other lesson can we pick? He says he found nothing in it but leaves. For it was not deceiving for fig. Now, there are two ways you can look at this. For example, if you look at the cashew tree over there, the cashew tree is already getting filled with leaves. One thing to start budding, because very soon, between January and April, there will be cashew on it. So, you see that coming out in preparation for that time. So, this tree may be full of leaves because it was preparing towards when it will be time to bring out the fruits. That's one way to look at it. The second way to look at this fig here, that was full of leaves, could be that, it was a tree that normally, normally, it has leaves. You know, if you have seen some trees. They have leaves, or usually that's another tree. Have you seen some trees like that? Of the same plant. But whichever way you look at it, either from the point of, you know, the nature of the tree, or from the point of the nature of time. The point is this. The Lord was to pass that way. You know, it was between Bethlehem and Jerusalem. The Lord was to pass that way. Now, ordinarily, if you take it from the point of, even if you look for any other fig around that time, it will not have fruit. It was not the seed of fig. Because if you look for any cashew around this time, you will not find fruit. It is not yet the time. Are you getting it? So if you look at it from the point of, it is not yet the time. Eh? Does the Lord cost the fig? You see, it brings me to, it brings me to, to tell you this. You see, be careful. The Lord was to pass the way of this fig. This fig is not like any other fig. Because it was in the Lord's way. Are you understanding me at all? Eh? I am speaking expositoryly now. Be careful with, ah, this is what everybody is doing. That is why I am also doing it. How will I have fruit at this time? It is not yet my season. After all, every fig cannot have fruit. But, this fig was standing in the way of the Lord. Be careful to understand what God is doing with your own life. Be careful to know what God wants to do with your own life. There is no way to compare your life with, eh? After all, in Nigeria everybody tells lies. Eh? Everybody tells lies. Look, forget this. I was talking to a lady one day. We were having a discussion. She was telling me about the church and all of that. And I said, I hope there is nothing immoral. She said, no, no, no, no, no. He said, no. But it doesn't mean that they don't, they don't have faith at all. That was contradictory for me. You are not yet married. I hope there is nothing immoral. He said, no, no, no, no. But it doesn't mean that they don't have faith. I said, ah, is that not immoral? He said, no. The reason why he said that is because maybe in a year once, he said, you know, that is a normal thing, sir. That is a normal thing. Don't let the people deceive you, sir. All the ones, you feel like it's a lie. Nobody can stand like that once in a while. There will be something. Even if it is nonsense sometimes. At least, you know, that's how you feel when you love somebody. I said, but it is not right. What I appreciated about her was her sincerity. Are you understanding me? Eh? But what I now began to teach her was her faith. Eh? Even if everybody is doing it, it doesn't make it right. Be careful with, this is the popular thing. Eh? God. Eh? The way of truth is a lonely path. Broad is the gate. And wide is the way that leads to destruction. Because narrow. Be careful with this fallacy of Bobo Enoloshi. Everybody, eh? Komo? That somebody says, no, God will understand for Nigerian Christians also. Eh? It's not easy to be a Christian in Nigeria. I want to ask you, what is it for that man to be a Christian? Under Nebkadeza. Eh? So when have it been easy before to live in this world? Did the man tell you that it will be an easy path? Since the day that we live a Godly life in this world, we suffer a lot. But we were never told that it's going to be an easy path. So why are you now saying that it's not easy in Nigeria? What I'm teaching you from the fifth tree this morning again, the second I'm trying to teach you. Eh? Be careful. Know what the Lord is doing specifically with your whole life. Know what the Lord is saying about your life. Be careful with it. After all, after all everybody, after all that is a common thing. It was a common thing. But the Lord cost the tree for not having fig. For not having any fruit. The Lord cost that tree. Because compared to all other worlds. It was a fig on the lost path. Be careful when God is saying something with your life. And doing something with your life. Be careful when God is showing you certain things. About to do things with your life. And God is pointing in a particular way. And you keep looking outside. Eh? Sheba wo yeno. Wo leto nye. Shebi amu brother tola wele. Stop it. Be careful to respond to what God is doing with your whole life. Be careful to know exactly what God is saying. And walk in that path. What is it again? I want to show you. Is that. Eh? As far as the Lord is concerned. Eh? The fruit. That is in verse 14 now. It says. In response Jesus said to it. Let no man eat fruit from you ever again. And his disciples heard it. Now. It means. As far as the Lord is concerned. Eh? For any life. The fruit. Eh? Take precedence over the leaf. As important as the leaves are. As important as the leaves are to us. Eh? Represent that you are born again. Represent that you have the gift of the Holy Spirit. You will be able to speak. In fact. The church of Corinth. Represented very well for us. Eh? That Corinthian church. Gives us a lot of them. Eh? It says. Eh? I give thanks. I am reading from Corinthians chapter one. From verse four. I thank my God always contending you. For the grace of God. Which has been given to you. By Christ Jesus. That you were enriched in every way. By Him. In all utterances and in all knowledge. Even at the testimony of Christ. as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you so that you came short in no words in no gifts he can't be waiting for the revelation of our lord jesus christ who also will confirm you to the end that you may be blameless in the day of jesus christ oh that was that was that was about that short eh yes speaking about that church he says um um i'm reading chapter three now two and three i read that last last month i said you would make not with solid food but until now you're not able to receive it even now you are still not able for you are still canada what am i trying to make you see is that a very sure gift does not separate a man from carnality does not separate the man from canada a man may be seriously gifted but he's still canada a man may be gifted and when you see him he can lay hands and then miracles take place he can lay hands to raise the dead he alone oh she don't work my mind now that was something it can be a one-man army it doesn't have to be one man only one man is the army of israel and the division is not happening it can be so gifted with power and grace and being one man but that does not mean that is spiritual what i'm trying to make you see to be spiritual is to be fruitful is not to be gifted it is the truth that makes that define the spirituality of a man the fruits take precedence over the leaves as far as the lord is concerned precedence over the leaves infact let me ask you what would the purpose of the leaves is to bring out fruits it is important for us to know That when a life does not bear fruit, when a life is not bearing for the fruit of the Spirit, and last point, I am taking time to define this fruit in two ways. People who were not there last month, please try to read the verse of last month. After you try to define the fruit, you can look at the fruit from basically two ways. You can look at the fruit from what Apostle Paul described in Galatians chapter 5 that we read earlier. Love, joy, peace, all of that, you know, a self-control, that's one dimension to the fruit. The dimension again to this fruit is the connectivity between that and our life. Eh? Bringing others to Christ. There's a relationship between that and your life, bringing others to Christ. You see, when you begin to bear that first fruit, eh, that is when, eh, you can by your life, bring others to Christ. Your gift, eh, may attract people to Christ, but when they encounter your life, they will leave Christ. Are you understanding me at all? Let me give you a good example of something. Let me give you a good example. A real example so that you can declare that. Please, eh, technical, is there any question? Not yet, okay. Okay, okay. Now, ah, if you, eh, I was having this, eh, somebody came to me for a counseling session. And we were discussing, and he said he wants to get something clear. He wants to get something clear. Ah? That, eh... He was, he was in church. She was in church. But she could not just follow the message. In fact, she just got up and left. That, she just wants to, to find out for me some things. That, is it that she's not, she's not been a Christian? We will wait for the message and prayer. Well, but we were having a discussion about that. She said, eh, she, she, I said what happened? I said, the first thing you tell me what happened? What happened to that? The first thing, what happened to be, the person to, to, for that day, eh, was the brother, eh, who had violated her sexual violence. Violated her, you know, forcefully. She didn't know she would meet him that day in that solution. in that day in that fellowship so when they called the man of god to preach and it was this person she was just cut off i mean network just left there was no network again to heaven we know he was getting angry provoked why why don't i say oh man of god rider she was being provoked something is wrong with her spirit i said something is wrong with your spirit what happens with that that life is full of leaves and the leaves can attract people to the lord but he cannot sustain them they need the fruits it is by the fruit that our lives begin to drop it that's the second level of the fruitfulness you know for our life to combat people hey i told you the case of someone who was in the market and went for you know he was in the market somebody was a clean step he basically stepped on somebody before he could say sorry it was a slap he couldn't say sorry to the person again he got so angry and said you are stupid for what you have the person you are mad for that that you have just said you mean and then there's all that stuff and then people separate them and then two weeks later they were to go for a jealousy and as they went from evangelism oh knocking on the door she went with at least two other people or himself and somebody and they knocked on the door it was not taking the force in the market that came out you could not push you know that they won't happen actually i wanted to tell you sorry that was not what you came what that what you came for why would you not preach because the life the life but if that other person did that yes and it was the way of jesus bless those who decide to leave you they said ah i'm sorry i i didn't do it intentionally the matter ended that way we didn't mess with evangelism we have to say ah no wonder pastor no wonder christian no wonder of course i wonder why do you revenge that day is that what you do so there is a way the fruits of long suffering joy patience all of that may not begin to make your life to become a life a city set on the hill cannot what cannot be hidden begin to draw me begin to draw me that's the second level of fruitfulness now it was not only drama it was the family love is is e that is why the fruit take precedence over the leaf and any life that does not bear fruit and now to you cannot be relevant to the lord that is why you see the lord cursing the tree as a lesson for us to learn it's not as if there's anything special about that tree but the lord want us to draw a lesson join a lesson that fruitfulness when a life is not truthful he has no place in the kingdom it has no place in the kingdom if somebody is the camera and let me show you why he has no place in the kingdom oh that's what you're just making up for sweet because in that tree you have this in the kingdom romans chapter 8 oh romans chapter 8 why the person have no place in the kingdom that tree no more have a place in the kingdom of the fields does it have a day it does not what happens it dried up it is no more what they are talking about the kingdom of him is nobody if anybody does not bring fruit if your life is not fruitful you cannot you cannot be a part of the kingdom it's not possible look at what the bible says in romans chapter romans chapter eight romans 8 there is therefore no condemnation for those who are in christ the condition for condemnation for those who are in christ jesus who did not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit for the love the spirit of life in christ jesus as may be free from the law of sin and death law could not do that it was weak through the flesh god did by sending his own soul in the likeness of the sinful flesh on account of sin he condemned sin in the flesh that the righteous requirement of the law that villainous who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit look at the five industries for those who live according to the flesh set their mind on the things of the flesh before by the things of the flesh you know we have mentioned them earlier you remember all those things that we mentioned in galatians we should go back to them but let us go on i want to get to a place here we'll go and look at them so for those who live according to the flesh set your mind on the things of the flesh for those who are going to the spirit of the spirit what do you see in the basket so to be carnally minded is what that is why the fig has to die or to be carnally minded is what is dead so to be carnally minded is dead when you are sick for to be carnally minded is dead but to be spiritually minded is life and peace why is cannot mind that verse 7 explains it for us let's look at verse 7 through verse 9 what did he say can we be from that transition that you are reading because the carnal mind is what and meeting with who it is god what's the next thing for it is not subject to what the law of god what's the next thing more indeed than what can be that is so those who are in the flesh cannot work cannot play something are you saying that are you saying that so it is very very important for you to i'm trying to make you see you know lessons of defeat hey as that feed dried up by the oppression of the lord you know that thing is not just dry all by itself it's dried up by the oppression of the lord anybody within the kingdom and is full of life by the oppression of the lord will dry up we're going be by the oppression of the lord because he will be as an enmity with god you cannot please god you cannot follow god by the oppression of the lord it is that same by that same oppression that that you will dry out of the kingdom it is it is not by anybody it is by that same oppression of the lord if you are not subject to his law you are enemy with him you cannot please him so where is your place in the kingdom when the bible says yes for it is god that works in us both the words both the will and to do of a good player as you find a young man who is not subject to the law of god who is an enemy of god who cannot please god so where is that person going by that same oppression that life will drown and i will drown you know and that is exactly what the picture the bible is creating for us in john chapter 15 in john chapter 15. let's look at the picture again in john chapter 15. we read that that last month but we don't want to emphasize this to another dimension now jesus began the lord began from verse one i have the true vine and my father is the vine say yes through thy fruit and it comes from us and instead of me! it shall be your fruit according to the things of this earth then thou shalt surely share thy art it shall remain through the days of men JESUS GOING AT WORK and we are beginning to learn that he who tú may do that he shall game away above it all he should not played away Because that is what the Lord will do to His enemies. He takes them away. They will dry up. Look, you will dry up. It's just a matter of time. You can't have a path in the kingdom. You cannot. It is just as clear things in scriptures. Eh? By the oppression of the Lord, He takes away. He takes away. It is He, the Father. When you are not bearing fruit, the Father operates in a way to take you away. The Lord actually looked at him and said, Let no man eat from you. It was the oppression of the Lord that made you to get dry. The oppression of the Lord. It was not by any man. It was the oppression of the Lord. The same way, by the oppression of the Father, every branch that is not bearing fruit, He has this way of doing what? Of taking them away. How He does it? These are mystical things. These are things you cannot explain. Eh? You know. It is the same thing you find when you are talking about the natural branches. Eh? And the grafted branches. Remember Romans chapter 11. He said, we are the Gentiles. We are not the natural branches. We are the engrafted. We are white olive. We are born into the natural one. Huh? You see, the natural one was made to fall because he does not believe. You too will stand because you believe. If you go into the assembly and don't believe. Eh? Don't forget that if God can cut away the natural one, cut it any place, He will not waste time. He will not waste time. Because He said, don't forget that it is the roots that carries you. Eh? Don't forget that God chose them. And we have mercy on what? We have mercy. He chose them, He chose them. They are the natural ones. All other ones, they are by the will of God. Why did God do that? Anybody can do anything with what he likes. If ten people are beggars and I got there. I give one twenty thousand. I give one ten thousand. I give one five thousand. I give one two thousand. I give one five thousand. I didn't give and I drive away. Am I a wicked man? Am I a wicked man? You can't define. You can't tell me. They will say I am wicked. But how do you define the wickedness? Am I not generous? You are defining it as if it belongs to them. No. It is mine. And I can do what I want with it. Sometimes we are defining God like some things from our point of view. And so we can decide when it is wicked and when it is not wicked. Why? We have mercy on what we have mercy. I had this. And there is no righteousness with God. But I keep telling people that if you look at the way God dealt with the natural branches in having kingdom in the earth when you are white you will live. Hey! Don't worry. Any hour we do it. I am not saying that this thing is very clear. The scripture made it clear. He who began the good work in us is able to finish it. The scripture makes it clear. He is able to keep us from falling. The scripture makes it clear that he is able to say to the whole time of those who by him come to God since he ever lived to make intercession for them. That what I mean is no contradiction of that. What I am talking about is you must get an understanding that when you say confident in this very thing that he who began the good work is able to finish it. Or what are you standing? You are standing on faith. You were justified by faith. He is able to keep me from falling. What are you standing? You are standing by faith. If you leave faith there is no basis for the standing. That's what I am saying. You are standing by faith. You are living by faith. Faith is the principle of justification. It's just like what they did in the wilderness. When was the last time that happened in the wilderness? To be saved from the bite of the serpent. What do you do? You keep looking at the one that is lifted up. If you look away the living ones will kill you. So we stand by faith. As long as we stand by faith he who began that work is able to finish it. But we know that we are standing by faith. We are not standing by rebellion. We are not standing by carnality. We are not standing by the rebellion of our standing. Carnality Carnal mindedness idolatry outburst of anger works of the flesh is not the rebellion of our standing. For the just live by word. But the very man draw back from faith. I have no pleasure in the point we are making. We are standing by faith. All that was promised to us was promised by faith. Because the just live by faith. Carnality is not the way of the faith. The works of death is not the way of the faith. Being an enemy of God is not the way of faith. He has a way of taking them. He mystically takes them away. And that is why I have learnt this point of criticizing you know when I stand on the pulpit to preach I am more interested in edifying the church than criticizing that one that one if it is not very true to the Lord. He has a way of taking them away. He will take them away. That is what I want you to see. The fig tree dries up. He will take them away. But everyone that is bearing fruit what happens? He proves that he may bear fruit. That is the same principle the Lord gave to he that hath. What will happen? That he may do what and he that hath not even what will be taken away from him may that not be our portion. You see people here you are already clean because of the word which I spoke unto you abide in me. You see it. That is the biggest of our standing. Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine neither can you unless you abide in me You know he is telling us how we can bear this fruit by continuously knowing the Lord knowing him listening to him following him learning him That is how the fruit begins to come forth He says take my yoke upon you and do what? Learn from me We get born again That is one level What is the second level? The level of discipleship The level of learning God discipleship Take my yoke and learn of me I am born again That is one level Learn of me My yoke is easy My body is light What will now happen? You will find rest for your soul There are several people who are born again but their soul is restless There is no rest for their soul There is no rest Let me tell you this truth It is because several young people don't find rest for their soul That is why when they get into relationships like marriage into fellowships into close relationships eh? eh? They also trouble others because these are said they don't have rest They are not at rest I know what they will be saying You know the blindness again They will be saying you are not giving me rest Ah! You see the problem is with him You say the problem is with him Eh? But the problem is with you Or you find rest for your soul Eh? It is not people I tell people What gives rest for your soul is not an individual That is why I tell wives It is not your husband that will give rest for your soul I tell husband It is not your wife that will give rest for your soul You are the one to find rest for your soul How do you find rest for your soul? Eh? discipleship Learn the Lord You are putting your own responsibility on people Learn the Lord You will find rest for your soul If you must find rest about the Lord Abide in me that is the point there You know I will bear much fruit For it has nothing you can do nothing If anyone does not abide in me What did he say? You see verses He is cast out as a branch And is withered And they gather them and throw them into the fire And they are burnt That is what That is a walking of the Father That is a walking of the Father For life That are not abiding in Jesus How he does that These things are mystical These are things we cannot ordinarily explain Eh? He has a way of Those who are not abiding in him That is why I tell people We stand because we are abiding We don't stand When we are enemies We don't stand When we are fighting No, it is when we are abiding Our standard is clear from the Bible As we abide in him As we abide in him As we abide in him That is the biggest of the fruitfulness And the fruitfulness Makes him to purge us again To bear more fruits To become more sanctified More holy We keep going on and on From grace to grace But if we are merely full of leaf, it has a way. Go and check it. I remember when I was working with my tomatoes, we had special scissors. They are the scissors for the farm. When it becomes so leafy, full of leaf, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut the leaf. Because if you don't allow the tomatoes to be big, it cuts the leaf. It will reduce the leaf. The leaves that don't have the tomatoes, that are long and are going to touch the ground. Because those ones, when they begin to touch the ground, it can have infection. We cut it, we cut it, we cut it. We keep pruning it. The ones, the areas that have tomatoes. And that will be caring for very long. We put it anywhere. We tie it off like this. We put it, we put that branch on the rope to carry it. We put it on that level again. The tree keeps going tall. We don't allow it to spread on the ground. We keep removing leaves. We keep removing leaves. You know, let's get it clear. We don't remove, you know, the purpose of the leaves is so that they have fruit. The Lord costs the fig. Because it was not fruitful. Any life that is not fruitful, God has this mystical way of taking them away. The basis of our standing is by faith. We stand by faith. I keep telling believers our standing. If you stand in that faith, you keep learning Jesus, I can assure you. Eh! You know I said something. You know what he said? This is the will of the Father. That of all that he has given to me, I should raise them on the last day. I'm so confident that the Lord will raise me on the last day. But I have a work of doing what? Abiding in him. I'm so confident that I've become so confident about this matter. When we began then? Eh! 30 something years ago. Yeah! Why don't you want backslide? We were so confident and don't backslide it anywhere. That if the Lord begin this work, he will finish it. But we must understand the principle of the Lord's working. This is very, very clear. You know. So, I've, I've, ehm... Technically, you are talking about, I believe we have answered the question that was raised last week. Last month. Yes, because I told you earlier that the person should wait. That we are going to make sure that that question the person asked will be answered. And I've answered it. The person was wondering what happens. You know. When one is not fulfilled, does that mean that the Lord takes away? Does that mean that he is thrown into the fire? Yes, the Lord has the Lord taken away. That's the truth about it. That's what the scripture says. But these things are mystical. You know. Let us, let us, let us, let us stand where the Lord stands. Let us be where he is. So that we will, you know. Great lesson from the fig. Great lesson from the fig for our life. You know. May the Lord keep us going. Ehem. May we, may we not go the way of the world. Ehem. There is a way of truth. Ehem. Let's walk in that way. And then our life will be continually fruitful. Ehem. No question was sent. I think I said no question. So, is that a question from the floor? Ehem. He didn't say anything. You should have raised your hand. This is a heavy twelve. I mean let us, we should have, let us know by, by, when, even when your question on the floor you should have raised your hand when it was twelve. Anything from around the eleven thirty that there is a question. But let's see what the question. We should be closing now. Nobody that is online too. Let's have you. May they move their minds so that they can hear your question. Sir, you're talking about how that ehem the Lord has a way of taking those that are not bearing fruit. He has a way of taking them and gathering them away. So like now, you know that in our times, there are people that we know that they have this gift and their lives will not be any fruit and most times they are always leaders that are also leading people and because most times, I think that they are leaders and so like they are not like misleading other people that are under them, those who are blinded by the gifts that they have. So the thing is now that, is it that we now wait for God, God said it is mystical to now take them away all, like there is also something that we can do to ensure that those leaders are not like those misleading people who are astray. Okay, what can we do? I think I've got a question now. What can we do in a case where leadership is misleading people? Is it that we keep watching them, misleading people and all of that? Yes sir. Now, when it comes to leadership, you see, one thing again about misleading, you know, misleading is another concept again, but let me just explain it this way. It says, as there were first prophets among them, there will be first teachers among them, did not make that clear? Who shall bring in damnable heresies? So what you said is true, there will be leaders who will bring that in. Okay. It says, and many will follow their ways, many will follow them. Now, in the issue of following them, eh, the Bible makes it clear again, eh, that we should, we should not that, we should preach, we should teach, we should collect, we should rebuke, for a time will come when men, eh, we no longer love truth, eh, but they will hope for themselves, teachers, having teaching ears, eh, and they will turn away from the truth and be following those teachers. So there are two sides to deception. That's what I'm trying to make clear. There are two sides to deception. The first side is the deceiver. The second side is the deceived. Eh, why do I say this? Why do I say this? Eh? Look at, why I am not saying that we are people, we are people that church, there is place of church punishment, church discipline. Where, for example, I mean, where the opposition where a leader was found to be sexually molesting, a place of church, I'm not saying that a leader was found to be sexually molesting, a place of church, I'm talking about the church discipline, may they be called a church discipline. A place of church discipline. disipline eh when that thing came to the public that was the way of god removing that person he has been doing the same on the ground eh and one day he was caught red and dead you get it so that was the way of god removing that person you got the point i'm making the person can remove three church disciplines uh you got the problem the person can there are different ways something god used to remove you know so what i'm saying is not against church discipline it's not against correcting people but you know followership cannot correct leadership eh you can only advise leadership leadership somebody who is a leader you also have people that are living with whatever people around you that god will use to correct you you got the point i'm going to bring up in different ways i've seen that in in various ways before that is also tell people don't grow to a point when you are no more subject to anybody there is nobody who by his gift listen to the difference i'm making nobody nobody by his gift and his place on the church this is what i mean on the church nobody is placed over the church by his gift everybody by their gifts they are in the church nobody is above the body we are all inside the body so don't go to a point where you are no more inside the body you have those who can checkmate you and correct you eh you have grown to where you are now where on the body so when you go on the body you're already outside the body so you begin to drive do you understand me at all that is one what i'm trying to explain is that sometimes the deceiver is being deceived because he loves deception there are people who love to hear things that make them feel well they are believers because these who are full of leaves eh they follow men who are full of leaves eh because they'll be saying things anybody look scrutiny is not stupid with you somebody slapped you that uh sat tap on his bible ah to show anybody so that they will know they will not take you for granted they're also teaching us like that is that what they're fighting for men who want to fight for me who don't want to deny themselves is that not the way so there are also people who know oh yeah there are also people who don't want to deny themselves is that not the way so there are also people who know you know you see the one thing about this eh the bible says we have the holy spirit in us who teaches us all things you see if you have somebody who is hiding in christ when somebody is not following christ you begin to desire if you are following somebody and the person is not following jesus and you are still following jesus someone will separate from that person that is the truth so now you just discover that you are no more flowing you just discover you don't miss you see those of the truth eh eh they follow the truth because ultimately like i tell everybody eh uh which is something they're handling again on monday during the discipleship i want to handle that more seriously the age the human agency in the work of god because somebody someone is still within their mind you are the one behind their job where is the additional sofas struggle where is the question about last monday discussion is it a woman or woman better NOBODY Metallurgy where is the place of human beings in the building of the church so i'll be handling that because i have read the last monday about on the way it really in the holy spirit that does the work of god so question was confused i said okay i will teach that question on monday you know why i don't know anything like that ultimately you must understand is the holy spirit that is the discipler there are disciples but there is a discipler but the discipler use humanity i will explain that very well okay the way the place of human you will see that if your life is not connected with a human against that something is wrong with your life there is always god works through human that is the truth about it but one of the things that people who are following people who are following evil leaders and they keep going on in the deception people in the session you also need to check their homework they themselves may not be following the truth the bible also make us to see that so as it goes this way it also goes the other way i don't know that question i've been outside okay so let's just close for today it's already after 12 we're also close for twice um thank you i hope no question though okay so let's let's close today let's let's thank the lord lesson from the field lesson from the field lessons from the field let's thank the lord for this time together learning looking into school learning from the field learning from the field our major concern today let's let us be careful about packaging packaging has become a global thing a global thing and it has become something that is acceptable in the church people are deceitful people are people are people are you know you know never straightforward compromising people do a lot of things today in the name of packaging not sincere not genuine not true oh let us be careful with packaging how do we respond to packaging we respond to packaging by growing in degraded grow and decided be able to design they will not deserve people to live able to understand people to get it you will to design design that this thing is not it the second major thing we made references to is that be careful the spirit of everybody is doing it you must know what the lord is doing with you particularly be careful that everybody is doing it because they cannot understand the project in the name of captioning and their bit by the law of law is not his was no preservation of knowledge because is om expansion of knowledge established faithate in the prophet of God and � Rudolph you are the teacher and do80 you ride shocked you are the teacher you are the partaker of inspiration I will say March of the moment going on for this and I'll назdeokialata zeor desktop we are the speaker of peace you are the speaker of peace we are the teacher and I will say March of the moment coming up over at the beginning you are the Lord be the teacher and and That everybody is doing it does not make it right. The way of truth is not the way of majority. But one, you know, how? One with truth, eh? One with God is majority. God alone forms the majority. Remember Micaiah. Micaiah stood alone. All the other prophets you are telling they have. This is the way, this is the way. But Micaiah stood alone. How? Micaiah stood alone. How? The way of truth is not the way of majority. Be careful to know what the Lord is doing with your life. The Lord was passing the way of that seed. Unfortunately, it was comparing itself with other seed. It is not yet the season of seed care. And why should there be fruit in me? That is how most brothers behave. That is what they are saying. That is the popular trend. That is how everybody is dressing now. That is why I am like that. That is why I dress sexy. Everybody is dressing. You continue to talk about some of the popular things. You are not looking at what God is dealing with your life. You are losing sight of what God is saying with your life. Oh, I pray you don't dry up. I pray you don't dry up. You must understand what God is doing with your life. And the last thing, the third lesson we take from that thing is that don't ever forget that the Lord takes away. He has the way of taking away. He takes away everyone. Every leaf, every branch that does not bear fruit. He has this way of taking away. How he does this? He knows how to do it. How he does it? Everybody has the way of purifying them. He has the way of making them expand. He has the way of making them grow. The whole is of the Lord. Oh, oh, the way of the Lord they are unsacrificable. His judgment they are pass finding out. His ways they are unsacrificable. His judgment pass finding out. The fruit takes precedence over the leaf. The fruit takes precedence over the leaf. The fruit takes precedence over the leaf. The fruit takes precedence over the leaf. Our Father we are grateful for today. Our Father we thank you. We bless your name. We lift you and we adore you. We thank you, O God, for this time again of learning together, of fellowshipping, O God, with one another. Lord, our God, we pray this afternoon. More Jesus lives in the name of Jesus. More of Jesus. More of Jesus. More of his will. More of his purpose. More of his life. More of his way. More of his truth. More of the manifestation of Jesus in us. More of our confirmation to him. In the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, eternal Father. In Jesus' name, we pray. We say the grace of fellowship. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. The love of God.

      "{\"source_url\": \"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ILJdjWHqwdL7E2McVDQxOEgRvwfn8YZB&export=download\", \"transcription\": \"churches and fellowships cannot be more spiritual than the individuals and families that constitute them god greatly desires a godly home front these are words of restoration and instruction and righteousness from family to ministry may you be blessed as you listen the reason why the lord is admonishing us from that text that you should do well and beg you say beggy so we are here to join the the host of great men that have you know written this bible that the lord has inspired to also beg you as sojourners and pilgrims abstain from fleshing those which were against the soul and you know what who is a sojourner like a like a like a stranger so that's the reason why you have been you know admonished to do what to abstain from fleshing those we watch against your soul as we continue we're talking about devotion to people purity purity purity when we are looking at purity you know god is pure i have a few minutes i'm just going to going to point point point if you want to talk about this 30 minutes we won't do that but the lord will help us he has told me where he's going to help you he said he knows where your needs are so rest assured he's here to do you good so when we are talking about purity there's nothing when we talk about purity there's no language of purity in the world the only way you talk about a pure purity is in God. Is in God. Why? Why is it that? That will lead us to realize in 1 John 2, 15 to 17, that we will get to read that verse, and do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is nothing. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the high, the pride of life, is not of the Father. Why is that? What? Love the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it, for he who does the will of God will do what? Abide forever. That is the state of this world you are in, as stranger and pilgrims. Impurity. This world is reserved for judgment. This world is reserved for fire. And you, you are here as stranger to fulfill a purpose. In this world. In this world, the Bible talks about that. That's the reason why he admonishes us that you should set your treasure on what? On things above. Hmm? So that where there is no thief, there is no moat, there is no rust. That is the state of the world. This world is reserved for fire. You can imagine, when something is reserved for fire, what are those things reserved for fire? They are things like your dustbin. I saw some heap of trash at the gate there. They are reserved for what? Fire. Fire. And it will be foolishness for anybody to now go and say these things are reserved for fire. They are the things I want to begin to run after. That is the state of anyone who run after the world and the things of the world. So the Lord is calling you to devotion to purity. How do you achieve that in this pambas world? World that is full of evil. He said anyone who loves but the love of the Father is lost. God's love is not in you. That means you are an abominable thing to God. When someone is an abomination to God, will such a person be with God at the end of the day? No. So we are not supposed to live according to the pattern of this world. Because we don't want to be abominable to God. So how do you keep yourself pure in this pambas world? The first thing I will emphasize here just like my story. I tried all I could. We were going to church. I followed my parents to church. They will beat me. They gave me instruction. There are rules. There are hectic values of my family. I just couldn't follow. I just find it difficult. I was not able. Why? Because of the nature of sinning in me. And I want to beg you here. That nature I will be taken care of by somebody. You need to be taken care of. You need to be taken care of by somebody. You need to do nothing for you to be delivered from that what that old was saying. That Jesus had done it. So if you have not come to Jesus at any time because it has to be deliberate. It's not a thing that you get by being born again or being a child of a pastor. Even if you are in your, let's assume your daddy is even Jesus. You must even by the standard and the presence of God you must still call the Lord Jesus to be your Lord. So that is the first thing. Without you surrendering your life to Christ without Jesus coming into the into your heart, being your Lord. Without you turning away from evil and saying Lord Jesus I talk to you. Just like what I teach. I just believe the gospel. I will build this teaching that day. Just like what? And I believe the word of God. That's a wonderful life. You say surrender your life to Christ. And I pray this in my prayer. I say Lord Jesus I turn my heart over to you. I turn from all my evil way. Jesus I have been in charge of this life so far. Even if I have achieved anything. Honestly it would have been a waste. Because they have been able to go. As long as it is not in line with what God has provided for salvation they are still going to be waste. So I have Jesus into my heart. And from that day I believe him. They congratulated me. Congratulations. That is the best decision you can take in life. And I want to tell you here. Your devotion to purity starts from there. What did I say? Your devotion to purity starts from there. Yes. Your being a child of God is the most superior honor you can ever have on earth. Because the monarch of the heaven and of earth is your father. And he has paid the price. Let me give you something. Let me tell you something. Nobody will go to hell first because he is a sinner. But you will not go there because you are a sinner. You go there because first you rejected the provision of God for salvation. He said because they do not believe they were condemned already. So that is the first thing. If you don't accept Jesus, that is the first thing. Your sin. Leave that. Just accept Jesus. He looks out to handle. He looks out to work. Everything you need to do the right thing is in that Christ Jesus. So that is the first thing to devotion to purity. Surrender your life to Jesus. Call him to be your Lord and Savior. Experience. Deliberate. Hand your life by faith. And as you are taking that decision sincerely in your heart, I congratulate you because your name will be written in the book of life. And it will be what? Deliberate. Exposed from the book of destruction. Because that is the word of God. Praise the Lord. So did you get that? That is the first thing when you are to be devoted to purity. I don't want us to gloss over that. We'll come to that. You will talk to Jesus in your heart and heart saying to come into your heart if you have not done so. Praise the Lord. Then another thing. When you are to be that. I haven't done that. I put here is that what? Oh. You are also created for the ultimate relationship with God. That is what we lost in Hedon. We got it back in Christ. When you surrender your life to Christ, you have a relationship. And relationship is the key. Tell your neighbor. Relationship with God is the key. Because that is the first thing. When God created myself and God said, the Godhead, and said, let us make man in our own image. Is that not? The essence is for relationship. So, if you must keep yourself pure, if you must be devoted to purity, that relationship is very important. How do you have that relationship? Let's look at somebody's life. Remember the life of whose life do I want to mention? The life of David, the life of Joseph. Bible talks about David being a man after God's own heart. Is that not? It was by relationship. If you go and study the life of David, even when he was still a young boy, you know, tending the flock of his father, he was a man of God's presence. He would take his harp, you know, singing, you know, have you gone through the book of Psalm? All those things are song, music, fellowship with God. You must have that fellowship. You must have that relationship. Look at Joseph too. Have you talked about Joseph? These people, they carve, they carve a niche. for themselves. You know, when they come to Christianity, we all have a level playground. Even if we are all children of God. But what will make you to stand out is what? The extent to which you have fellowship with God. Just by what we are hearing. I'm not feeling like us today. But I'm very sure there are some people that are exceptional. Maybe the best student in one class. Who are not the best? The person carved a niche for him or herself. During the extra, during the extra to keep that position I want to be. And now, like that. But I'm not being good, but I'm being an excellent person. So when it comes to your life being pure, you go the extra in your work with God. In your work with God. I have something here. I have something here as a, as a, okay? Let me quickly talk about that. One of the extra things you will do. One of the extra things you will do, I have here that is about your lifestyle. It's about your lifestyle. When we are talking about devotion to purity, it's about your lifestyle. Some of us are sleeping. They say your your lifestyle, maybe it's not your style. Don't worry. You will soon go and sleep for the long way, the night. I mean, so when we are talking about your lifestyle, we are not talking about your devotion to purity. This relationship we are talking about, do you know the reason why it's very important? If you don't have that intimate relationship with Jesus, it will affect your lifestyle. So what, you can't be on the fence. Some other thing will be taking your attention. But when you have your fellowship, in studying, you know, in learning about God, just like you gather today, and not only when you are here, when you are alone in your room, your determination sets out time to know the Lord. When you do all that, it will do what? It will mold your lifestyle. It will mold your lifestyle. And that will help us. Let me give you the example of somebody. I have a story here. Will you listen to me carefully? I call the story Iguana's story. Iguana's story. Say it. How many of us know Iguana? That creature that looks like Lisa, but very big. Good. Let's listen to this story. This story is to make us see the effect of our lifestyle. Okay, let's see. Are we together? A few years ago, this is the story of a man. He got two iguanas. I satisfied an unfulfilled child through an urge by adopting a pair of baby iguanas. Do you know what he called their names? He called one Liberty and Justice. What was their name? Liberty and Justice. These two iguanas were about the same age and size when they had arrived at their new home. Where was their new home? The person that got it. God bless him. Like any good father of two, I did my best to treat them equally. No partiality. They scampered around the same 55-gallon aquarium. The man put them in an aquarium. Drunk from the same water dish. Soaked in water from the same hot rock I eat now. A vitalized shorn on both. In short, my let me pouch here an identical environment. That is, they were open to the same environment, the same kind of feeding and so on. There was just one noticeable difference in their lifestyle. In their what? Lifestyle. That is the difference. Let's go on. He called the difference diet. Will you say diet? Diet. You know what diet is? The kind of food you eat. While Liberty consumed fruits, vegetables, and various forms of protein, Justice was a picky eater with a meager appetite. Consequently, after a while, Liberty grew bigger and stronger. A rich-colored muscular animal, but lacking proper nutrition. Justice became lethargic. Liberty, bigger, stronger. Justice became lethargic. Why? Because of lack of proper nutrition. She got thinner and assumed a pale shade of grey. You know when they say somebody is pale in our own human being, we say there is no doubt. Because of the kind of diet, this Justice had to begin paying. From that point on, if Liberty wanted to burst on the hot rod, he commandeered it. Why? Why was he able to do that? Because it was bigger, muscular. If he chose to drink, Justice had to get out of his way. It was only a matter of time before Justice poured diet aggravated by Liberty's bullying. And that led to what? Death of Justice. So sad. This life just won L.D. Iguana to rule the world aguerrido. That is the lesson for us. Children, my children, are you listening? It is not just a great lesson for your lifestyle from this. This story tells us that it illustrates the inner conflict facing all of us as Christians. We need each of us dwell to nature. Two worlds need each other. Do you know them? The flesh and the spirit. They share the same environment. The same body and senses. Like Italian roommates, these two nations become territorial. Is that not? In us, people adversarial, each want to rule the aquarium of our hearts, your flesh, and your spirit. I mean, the spirit want to rule, the flesh want to rule. Just like the Justice and what? Yes. They want to rule the aquarium of our hearts. Our flesh, and the spirit. Let's continue. They want to rule the aquarium of our hearts and mind. The one that eats best will be the one that strives. Is that not? The one that eats best will be the one that strives. You remember L.A.? The one that eats best Rule the aquarium What is ruling the aquarium of your heart Is it the flesh that is sitting next Who are you feeding Is it your spirit man Are you feeding your spirit man How do you feed your spirit man Let the word of God dwell in you Richly in all wisdom That is how you feed your spirit How do you feed your body I will show you A lot And heaven is so smart He has bombarded us With a lot of things to feed our flesh And in the feeding of our flesh Our purity is being taken away And what happened He said Let me quickly go back Our lesson The one that eats best Will be the one that tries But keep in mind That the dietary preference of the spirit And the flesh are quite Different The spirit is nourished by what By the reading of the word of God By studying By praying By fellowship with God's children By the association you give The flesh is nourished By appetite for junk food What are they Movies Scenes of sexual nature You know we watch movies Movies, scenes

What is the last point I called out for you? No, no, no The point Be the Christian Use the Christian worldview Don't follow the worldview There are several views to this world But the Christian worldview And the road map For that Christian worldview Is the Bible Do you have your Bible there?

Who are your friends? You have to be careful About your friend Who are the people You walk with? And if you walk With the wrong A wrong person Somebody that does not share The same value The same worldview Of the Bible And that is your friend What is likely to happen? You will meet you In the wrong position In the wrong way Not only that Yes Good You don't see your focus He will take The original from you And give you his life to run You will be running his life It's all like gender Is that what you want? No Why don't we look at the life of Daniel You know the three Hebrew men Boys in the Bible I will talk about The association If you don't choose You can invite us to there Maybe you want just Because of the life of Daniel Amesha Shadrach Abednego You know Go and check Go and read About their life You will see that these people This kind of association Help them You know to be focused This association Helps them in danger Remember when The king Planned to give all the Magicians That were not able To interpret history Not only to Interpret The king wanted them to Say the truth To interpret history And also to interpret When those other magicians Were disturbed Looking for what to do And the The The Daniel got a God made up information What did he do He went back to his friends And said Oh this is what I will do This is what the And he went back to the king He said Please give us time When Daniel went back to the king And requested for more time He now went with his friends And they said You know what We are going to go And we are going to go To the king And they said Please give us time When Daniel went back to the king They requested for more time They prayed They planned together You know They strategized What are we going to do That is an association That is helpful That is the kind of association That will keep you pure That will help you You know To get to the top The next They prayed I mean And what happened God revealed The dream And also the interpretation What kind of friend Do you have What kind of friend Do you have What kind of friend Do you have What kind of friend Do you have What kind of friend Do you have What kind of friend Is he the one That is working with you To fulfill your God-given mission Or the one That is taking you Far away from death First tell yourself That will not Be a destiny Destroyer Say it to yourself . Do you know Why I have you. To say that Because you are A friend of somebody A friend of somebody If you are not good You are not correct Who ever associates With you will also be what? Will not be correct. God, deliver me from destiny destroyer. Ask yourself, am I one? In the life of that my friend, in the association, in my class, among my friends, what am I contributing to their purity? So for you to have a devotion to purity, your life being set apart, not being bastardized by all the things I've mentioned, you know, all the immorality, all the wrong diet we have through social media, through so many interactions we have today. You must what? You must mind who you are first. Then, who you associate with. But for eventual, you are somebody that your life is that you are only not only what? Your hungry nature is the flesh. And you are giving the nature all the food, drugs, what are the junk food that are going to bring us to impurity? They are movies of sexual nature. Violent video games. If all you know, you learn violence. That is the reason why you want to do anything. All the problems we have in society today. Some people start somewhere and as they were watching, they never knew that their life is being, you know, customized into that. The course was so even you watch, you listen to, you, you, you, you, through all these things. They are the one that works. They are part of you. They will confirm, they will, they will confirm you. They walk on your mind. They walk on your will. They become your behavior. So stop feeding your flesh. Feed your, feed your flesh. These are the food for the flesh. Anytime you see your life yourself, loving to sit down with sexually, sexually immoral things, or friends, or you see yourself, you know, where there are graphic violence, where there are video games of violence or immorality, songs that celebrate rebellion, that is of drug use, that's of songs that sing about drug use, casual sex, skill theology. When you see those things, for you to stay pure, what should you do to them? You run. Somebody ran in the Bible and the person was a youth like you. You run, you run, you run. Turn away from all those things because they are not going to keep you pure. They are going to do what? They are going to reconfirm you. They will turn you to what? To something God has not intended for your life. And that will not be your portion in Jesus' name. So, we are saying, our media, be careful of media products that affect, because they affect your thoughts, wills and emotions. They affect you seriously. And we also learn from this, Iguana, I know of a story of a girl. I'm trying to look for that story. I've used it amongst some teenagers before. The story of a girl because of the pollution of the world. Because of the pollution of the world. Don't forget that you are what? You are sojourners and pilgrims. We have mentioned that. Don't be deceived by the world view. Follow after Christ's view. What we call the Christian view. Whose world map is what? It's the Bible. Praise the Lord. And lastly here, I want to also give you this story. Are you interested? Let me quickly give you this story. And that is what I will use to wrap it up. This story is, we call the story, the story is grace. Uh, if I was to get it, I'm not able to get it. Maybe another time. Maybe another time. I'm not really laying my hand on it. Okay, let me just paraphrase it. For us to see that the world, the world view, the danger of the world view. You know, this girl was just a very young girl that just entered school. She was going to university. And when she got to university, the first person she met, the first lecturer that took him, uh, took her in. I can't remember the topic now. But it's something about, uh, uh, creation of the world. And that person came up with his tension to confuse all the children, all the students, and told them that they all came from him. You know this, this evolution thing. And the man did all that he could. That is what they think. Grace was trying to tell Lord Jesus. That the man almost took from her what she had been laying under her parent in a Christian setting, marrying for over 20 years. And that is the deception I want you to see about the world. That is another thing the world is using to take us from purity. There are different songs. I believe, doesn't matter. You'll be, you're not, you'll just be the, the only one, the only hot one out. Is that not? Eh? Okay. We only need once. God bless you. Don't be deceived. That is the deception the man had. But thanks be to God that Grace was able to understand it that hard. This man wants to take away from me just in a class or maybe in a semester. Be careful. That is what the world is all about. What you are believing. There are different skills, theology, ideas, philosophies all around today. Some will come to you, show you on their phone. They will tell you things that will make you to doubt what you are believing. They only want to be like what? They want to turn you into eh, eh, eh, I can't remember now. You know, just, it's coming and going. Don't worry, I will remember. Manipulating you. Yes, like manipulating you. They will not be in charge of your life. They will turn you around. Be careful. So you can see that when it comes to devotion to purity, it takes a lot of action from your head. It takes a lot of watchfulness about your life, about your association. Don't be careless about what you watch or listen to. It comes like play by play. But the deed would have been done. Something would have been deposited into your heart. And let me tell you something. There are many of you, if you want to be sincere with you, with yourself. There are times you pick up some things you watch. Maybe there are these phonographic things and after that moment you don't want to remember it again. You don't wish to continue. But what? The monster has been taken in. What happened? When you close your eyes, you see it. I mean, when you don't want to think about it, you are thinking. And that is the danger in what we are talking about. They are not just ordinary. That you are here today, what made you what you are? Or big as you are. It's an accumulation of what you have been trained from childhood. So all those things are the things that sum up your life. So when you break in all this impurity, you begin to feed your flesh. You begin to nurture your flesh. What is gathering, not just throwing at you. Before you know it, you become a monster. By your way of life. Some people will say, I don't even know how I got to this point. I can't even understand. I just told you about myself now. How will a primary three primary three girl be a cadet? Twice, I was just in wrong association. Those girls do not trust me in class. And every time they send me to high school, I just follow. And before you know it, I tell this to many people. I say it is this generation. This generation, thank God for you. You have a lot of disadvantages. I am very sure they would have used me for by now, they would have used me for Juju. That time, we were just reckless. There was something pushing us to do nothing. We would feed on what we was just controlling our life in the negative. Until when Jesus, we open up. And when I open my life to Jesus, I say, come in. I ran from those things. I remember him. He took a deliberate effort to begin to memorize the bible. To read the word of God. To meditate on it. When it comes, I say, no. I am a new creation. All things are passed away. Behold, all things are. It wasn't easy. So be careful. You have to be devoted to your purity. Everything in this world is there to do what? To make you impure. There is nothing in this system that is towards God. They are always against God. I told you, the bible talks about this world being reserved for destruction. He is going to bring a beautiful new world. This world is already bastardized. So every system in the world, everyone be a fashion. You see man, they say it's no longer lasting. They will bring it here. There is a mission to keep you impure. To strengthen your soul. That is the reason why you just have to be careless about your life. You have to pay attention to fitting of your spirit. Because that is where you have your strength. Guide your heart with all diligence. From there comes the issues of life. You have to guide. How do you guide it? Meditating on the word of God. We have mentioned it. Prayer. Correct association. Be deliberate about the things of God. Make up your mind. That you will not be lost after the things of this world. When they flash at you, you know they will flash, you are in this world. You do what? You flee. You run. So that you can stay pure. And the Lord will keep you pure in Jesus name. Praise the Lord. People will pray. I don't know if you have anyone here. You have not at any time called upon Jesus. Nobody will do it for you. It must be deliberate. You must make up your mind. Jesus don't force himself on anybody. He said I'm at the door knocking. If you hear me, hopefully I will come in. And it's for your own good. The devil will force himself on you. In fact, there are times the devil has invited you to come and see things that belong to him. You thought you just want to look and go. But you come to discover that as you knew you couldn't go again. And that is the devil for you. But when it comes to the Lord Jesus who wants a relationship. You know we talked about that. So as you bow down your head this afternoon. I want you to bow down your head. If you are not at any time you cannot even remember any time you have deliberately, consciously asked Jesus. Because you need him. You need him to stay pure. You need him to walk in his steps. You need his devotion from him. No one can help you. I want you to bow down your head and speak. Call the Lord Jesus. Deliberately. Lord Jesus I think I'm ready. Call him. No matter the depths. No matter how far you have gone from him. No matter how far. When you call him you will call. He's always there. He's the only way. The truth and the life. He's the only help you have to stay pure. Tell the Lord Jesus. Tell the Lord Jesus I turn away from my evil ways. I turn away. I turn away. I turn to the Lord. I turn to you. Every provision available for my salvation. For my purity. Here I am. Lord Jesus I hope of coming. Come into my heart. I surrender my life to you. Come into my heart. Come and be the Lord of my soul. Come and be the Lord. Take your place. I want to feed you. Come and feed my spirit. Because as you read the word of God being mixed with the presence and the spirit of God in you. Are you taking that decision? Are you praying? Are you calling? Maybe you want me to join you in prayer. Or you want me to stay connected with you. So that I can identify you. If you know you are taking that decision can you raise your hand? Okay. And I know later you will also meet me. So that I can pray with you. So that I can pray with you. So that I can also get connected with you. Okay. Now I want us to pray. Put down your hands. I want us to pray. If you are also there. Maybe you have taken this decision at a time. Or you are not sure where you are now. Maybe probably you have been feeding the wrong nature. You have been feeding the flesh. And that one has grown more solar. It has even pulled the spirit to it has not only pulled it has killed the spirit. Come upon the Lord Jesus and say Lord I changed my diet. I changed my diet. I want to stay pure. I changed my diet to the story of the world. I changed my diet to fellowship with you. I changed my diet to correct spiritual things. I turned away from every pollution. Everything that I have been eating. Every wrong way of life. Every movie. Every sexual you know sexual perverse movie. Every violent movie. Every of these graphic things. Parvasity. You know rebellion that I have been celebrating in what I watch. In what I listen. I turn away from them. I turn away Lord Jesus. I turn away. I turn away. I no longer feed my flesh. I no longer feed my flesh. Oh come upon the Lord. I say Lord Jesus please have mercy upon me. I want my spirit to be filled. I want to begin to feed my spirit. I want to begin to feed my spirit. Feed my spirit. This spirit for us all died. Bring me alive. Bring me alive. Resurrection might be like Bring me alive. Bring me alive. Bring me alive. I choose the right diet now. I choose oh Lord the Godly lifestyle. I choose the road map of God which is the Bible. I choose the Christian world view. I will no longer follow the world view because it's the things that will keep me pure. Lord please help me. As you are taking that decision don't think you are joking. God is here to help you. He is not in you. He is releasing grace and strength upon your life. As long as you are making up your mind it's much more energy and the side is going to carry you. Oh Lord thank you because you will do so. We give all the glory Lord. Father in the name of Jesus. Amen. Jehovah will lift up your children. Thank you for those ones that have surrendered their life to you. That have asked you to be the Lord and saviour of their soul. That have turned away from their evil ways and turn to the Lord. Oh Father you send him only for who has sinned. He is as red as canadish and made it as white as snow. Oh Lord thank you because you will wash them clean. Thank you Father for cleansing them. We pray oh Lord Jehovah God the strength to go in this newness of life. The strength to go and see no more. Grant unto them in the name of Jesus. Amen. We lift up every one of them. There are those that have just surrendered to Christ and those that have given their life to Christ and one way or the other they may be feeding the wrong nature. Lord I have to invite you to this evening. They have turned a new leaf. They have made up their mind no longer to feed the wrong nature. To change their diet. Oh Lord to the diet of the spirit so that the flesh will not kill them. We pray Lord God Almighty strengthen this commitment to them in the name of Jesus. Oh Lord undertake for them in this decision in the mighty name of Jesus. Lord we pray you will carry them. Oh Lord remind them. Lord write it upon the table. Lord write it on their heart. Oh Lord we pray all these spirits that you will always remind us of all things that we have been taught. Remind them at every junction so that they will always take the right decision in the name of Jesus. And we pray Lord they will stay pure in the mighty name of Jesus. They will be devoted to purity in the mighty name of Jesus. Thank you faithful God. I pray they will be good friends. They will be good enough that their life will not change. But that through their life many will know the Lord Jesus. And I pray Lord you will choose correct friends for them in the mighty name of Jesus. Thank you Father for answers to my prayer. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.

God will indeed desire the God-loving hearts. These are words of restoration and instruction in righteousness. We firmly take these with us. May we be blessed as we are blessed. The Lord. Be the Lord. The Lord. We give glory to our God again for today. We thank him for his love, for his mercy. We thank him for all who he is. We thank him for all that he is to us. Indeed, our God is great. Our God is mighty. We want to thank him for the privilege of entering into a new month again. The month of, the month of March. We appreciate God for his mercies and for his love. Indeed, it has been God. It is still God. And it will yet be God. We appreciate him for how he kept us through the month of January and February. Reserving our lives and helping us, standing with us, standing by us, and undertaking for us several in different ways. Honestly, God in whom we praise in the name of Jesus Christ. I want to welcome everyone again to the month of March Singles Club. And I believe that as we all gathered together this morning to fellowship with the Lord, to fellowship together, it will be a time of reflection in the name of Jesus Christ. One thing that is certain is that God will always remain faithful. And because he would remain faithful, we can be sure. We his children, we cannot be consumed. The Bible says, the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. Never ceases. And his mercy never comes to an end. They anew every morning. Grace is his faithfulness. And I believe, his faithfulness will continue to shatter us through as we move on through the year in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us have a word of prayer as we turn, as we begin the meeting for this month of March. We remember that we started a very important topic. In the month of February, we see instruction. And I believe, in the month of March, we will continue from where we left the matter in February. The matter of instruction. And so, we are taking the second episode of that topic today. Instruction. Let us have a word of prayer. Precious Father, we are grateful unto you. We thank you for your love and for your mercy. We thank you for your goodness towards us. Our Father, we are really, really grateful for bringing us into this third month, which is the month of March. We are indeed grateful for your mercy and for your love. And Lord, as we commence the meeting this morning, we pray that we all together, our brethren who are connecting on Telegram, our brethren who are connecting on Whistler, our brethren who are gathering here physically, Lord, we pray that it will be a time indeed, a time indeed of meditation, a time indeed of blessing, a time indeed of encounter, in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, our eyes are open. Let nothing prevail against your purposes for our lives, in the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Eternal Father. Blessed be your Holy Name, our God. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. We move on from where we left the matter in depth. We are looking at instruction. Instruction. Particularly, when we relate it to younger generations. We listen to our singles, our about-to-be-married, young men, young women, the matter of instruction. I must call back again, or remind you again, of some of the fundamental things we mentioned in the month of February. Number one, we saw that instruction is something to live part-old of. That is Proverbs 4, verse 23, verse 13, sorry, where it says, take part-old of instruction. Do not let her go. Keep her, for she is your life. We saw that instruction is something that we need to live part-old of. Instruction is something we must not let go. Instruction is something that we must diligently guide, not to lose it. And then we mentioned last month, that why is the Bible, why is the Word of the Lord, why is the Holy Spirit instructing us that we must take part-old of instruction? We must not let her go. Why must we guide her? Why must we, why must we be, you know, be intentional and deliberate about instruction? We saw that there are two things to note. We said, the first one is that on one hand, there are pleasures. There are pleasures that may want to make you live instruction. I will give an example from the life of Saul. Saul was told to wait for seven days. Unfortunately, there was a pressure. The Philistines were advancing. And as they were advancing, they were advancing, ah! Saul became afraid. And because he was afraid, he did not hold to the instruction he was given. Wait for Samuel to come to do the sacrifice. Unfortunately, he went ahead to do the sacrifice. And immediately, it was through with the sacrifice, Samuel appeared. And Samuel said, why did he do it? And then he said, he, ah, Samuel was not coming on time after that. But the Bible says, that was how the kingdom was taken away from him. So we said, it's good. One thing that we want to take instruction from you is the revelation God gave you. The instruction of God to your life. The instruction God gave you. The revelation God placed in your heart. That thing that God told you, this is what I'm going to do. This is how I'm going to do it. Wait for me. The promises of God for your life. Be careful. They are precious. The second one, you noticed that long, was provocation. Be careful. Provocations can make you throw away instructions. For example, the movie. So, last month, our focus was, number one, ah, you must take passage of instructions. You must not let her go, because she is your life. And the reason why we must take passage of instructions, is because number one, they are precious. And number two, they are provocations. So we must, if we don't guide our life, against pressure and provocations, we may find ourselves losing the instructions that God gave us. We may find ourselves going against those instructions. That was our focus in the month of February. Now, in the month of March, this very first day of the month, what are we going to focus on? Under the topic, instructions, the second episode. What are we focusing on today? What we are focusing on today, ah, is trying to comprehend, to comprehend, ah, this matter of life, that instruction is. Ah, we want to try and understand. What is it that the Bible says, instruction is your life? Why is the Bible, says, that you, be on your guard, be on your guard. Instruction is your life. Instruction is your life. Why is the Bible, letting us to assume, that actually, instruction is our life? Why is instruction, our life? And that is what we want to look at, in this month of March. Why is instruction, our life? The matter of instruction. Why, as we try to say, instruction, is your life? And, as we try to solve this matter, this morning, I really pray that, ah, the Lord, the Lord, with, each and every one of us, ah, in those areas, that we really need most, in the name of Jesus Christ. Ah, in, in beginning the matter, I want to call your attention, to, the picture I created, in the month of February. And, we consider the picture, in the month of February. Ah, the picture in Genesis. And that is what, I want to really build on. I want to build on it. So that, you can properly comprehend, why you must do everything, to guide against pressure. Why you must do everything, to guide against provocation. Not allowing, pressure and provocation, ah, to make you, ah, to lose, your life. And when we say life, what is it, that call me to this matter of life? When God says something, it's your life. What is God really saying? Now, I want to, make reference, to the book of Genesis. Let's go to Genesis. I want to, make reference, to the book of Genesis. Now, I want to, make reference, to the book of Genesis. I want to, make reference, to the book of Genesis. Now, let's go to Genesis. Genesis, chapter two. The book of Genesis, chapter two. Genesis, chapter two. Let me, what God said, when He was giving, instructions, to Adam. When He came to Adam, the Lord, the Lord said, that, the Lord said, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, you may freely eat. Of every tree of the garden, you may freely eat. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat. For the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die. Now, I want you to note something as we look at the matter of instructions. This was the first instruction we are seeing in the Bible. I want you to understand something about God. Please understand something about God. What is going on here in Genesis? I want you to understand that it's a mystery. And that is why, many times, people don't understand, you know, fundamental issues that the Bible makes reference to when it comes to the New Testament. Please, don't ever forget that why the two Testaments are separate Testaments. The two Testaments rest on one side and the other on the other side. The two Testaments rest squarely on fulfilling the Old Testament. In fact, if you remove the Old Testament, the New Testament don't have direction. What gave direction to the New Testament is the Old Testament. The New Testament only came to tell us that, See, everything God said He's going to do, He has done it. That is the New Testament. Everything that God said that He's going to do, it has been done. The Old Testament is where God was saying, I am going to do, I am going to do, I am going to do, I am going to do, I will do this, I will do that, I will do this. The New Testament, it's just pure, it has been done. It's just a fulfillment. You don't properly comprehend some issues that are raised here. You might be having serious problems living a correct Christian life. In fact, the matter of life, please don't forget, that when Jesus came to the scene, what did He say? For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in this Son will not perish but have everlasting life. It was the matter of life that was raised in these instructions. God said, God commanded the man, said, of every fruit of the garden, you may freely eat. Mark the word, freely eat of every fruit. But there is a truth that you don't eat of. The day you eat, you will die. The day you eat, you will die. This was the first instruction. And it is this instruction that the matter of death was first mentioned. It was first mentioned in the Bible. I want you to comprehend death from God's perspective. The matter of death was mentioned by God as a consequence for a tree, from a tree, which means, which means Adam, at this point, was not in need of eternal life. Since he was made in the image of God, and in the likeness of God, he was made to, he was made to exist like God. If there was no sin, Adam would have still been here with us. We too would have been here like this. It would have been eternal. Now, it was in this place that God introduced the matter of death. And the death was played side by side instruction. Don't forget where we are coming from. Take fast hold of instruction. Don't let our group go back for the same. Don't allow pressure and provocation to make you to throw away instruction. Don't allow pressure and provocation. Something pressurizing you. Something provoking you. Something seems to be offering another alternative. Don't allow any of these things to make you throw away instruction. Take instruction because life is in instruction. You have seen the matter here. God said, the day you eat, you will die. Now, let us look around this instruction. Because this is where the defeat of the enemy is. Look around this instruction present. Instruction that God is giving to man here. This instruction. Is this instruction a way of limiting man? Is there any limitation in this instruction? This instruction is to give a person a way to do more. He said here it is easy. There is no limitation in this instruction. It is to not leave the body in this instruction to the death. This instruction is the knowledge of the kingdom. And this instruction is the way to death. You can eat freely. But, of the three of the knowledge of good and evil, you should not eat. The day you eat of it, you will die. Now, I want you to imagine the garden. A garden of, the Bible says God made different kinds of tree. This is called a garden of eternal life. This is the way of eternal life. A garden of eternal life. A garden of eternal life. People used to call it sowing. We are talking about sowing. We are talking about sowing auf die Welt to grow out of that garden. God planted a garden in the east of Eden. Out of the ground, God made every tree grow that is seven to the size and good for food. The tree was not planted in the midst of the garden except a little good and evil. God made trees, different trees. And what Baba said is that you can eat... Look, take mango. I'm just making an example. We are not told the type of trees. I'm just taking an example. Take an example that there are hundred or fifty types of trees inside that garden. Mango, apple. Carrot. Banana. Just keep mentioning fruits. Leaves. Different kinds of things. God said, leave an earth. It's your food. I've commanded it for your food. So look at different leaves and earths. Look at them in their thousands. Just look at them in creation. And Baba said, it is only one that you should not eat. Only one. Please. Is that instruction a limitation? Or a libration? You are allowed to eat except one. It's not the other way. Only one accepts everything. What can first time to make you see? Is this deception or the devil? When it comes to the matter of instruction. Many times, young people are made to think that God's instruction is the limitation of enjoyment. You know, you will not have abundance. It will not allow you to enjoy. God's instruction, they are, you know, they are burdensome. The will of God is limiting. It does not allow you to, you know, you don't have all kinds of freedom. That is a lie. That is a lie. Young man, young woman. Taken by this deceit of the devil. The instructions of God. In fact, look at how our Apostle John put it. He said, and we know that his commandments are not grievous. Oh, may the Lord deliver our generation. May the Lord help our young men, our young women today. In fact, even so many fathers and mothers, many adults that don't understand these truths. When you talk about monogamy, they say it's limitation. When you talk about not committing adultery, oh, they say it's limitation. When you talk about not fornicating, they say it's limitation. You don't need to be free to eat and eat and do anything. Oh, when you talk about moderation, they say it's limitation. Oh, may the Lord deliver our generation of young men and women today. And so many fathers and mothers, old men and women who are teaching children in hearts. Children in understanding. The commandments of God are not grievous. Commandments of God are liberating. The commandments, look. I must tell you a group of young men where I went to minister. You know what I told them? I said, listen to me. Listen to me. Even if there is no heaven and there is no hell. If everything ends here. I mean, everything about heaven and hell is just a deception. If it is a lie, there is nothing like that. They are just deceiving us. And I would still prefer to live the Christian life. The first truth I want you to see about instructions being lied. Is that number one. The instructions of God, they are not limiting. They don't limit you. The instructions of God are actually liberating. Look at how our Lord Jesus put it again. He says, come unto me. All ye that labor and are heavy laden. And I will give you rest. And take my yoke upon you. Learn of me. For I am meek and lonely in heart. And you will find rest for your soul. Why? Why? My yoke is easy. My body is light. The yoke of Jesus is easy. The yoke of Jesus is far easy. His body is light. The body of the Lord is light. The instructions of God, they are not heavy. They are not things that are heavy. They are things that are light. If you are thinking the instructions of God, they are heavy. If you are not seeing them as light and enjoy it, then something is fundamentally wrong with your spirit mind. There is a blindness somewhere. Something is blinding you from the truth of God. So the first thing I want you to see about instructions is that the instructions of God. They are not bodyful. Don't let anything deceive you. Don't let anything control you. Instructions of God are not bodyful. Then number two. You are looking at instructions. Why is instructions your life? Eh? It is when you go against instructions that you are going into what is every body. You are going to what is a label. Eh? It is common to know you that label and a heavy body. It is when you leave the lost instructions that you are going to carry a body that is heavy. A body that is not light. So the first thing I want you to see about instructions. When I say that it is your life. Eh? It is that what God is offering you is something that is easy. Eh? It is light because it is easy. It is light. It is not a body. It is not designed to press you down. It is not designed to limit you. It is not designed to cut you short. That is not the design of God's instructions. Because it is actually light. Number two. When you look at this Genesis chapter 2. God said the day you eat it you will die. The day you eat it you will die. Eh? He said instruction is your life. Eventually the ethics. When the ethics? They die. They die. The death that they die. That death. That occurred. Eh? Was not a biological death. It was not a biological death. It was actually an eternal death. It was an eternal death. Because when they die. You know that they did not fall to the ground. Eh? Biologically Adam was alive. God simply questioned him. Where are you? He said I am myself. I am out of that. Seriously. The death that God was talking about in this. Was not a biological death. The death that God was talking about in this. Was an eternal death. Now. It was that eternal death. That brought Jesus back. That brought Jesus to the stage. Where Jesus prayed for God so loved the world. Eh? That he gave his Holy Begotten Son. That those who have not believed in this Son. Would not perish but have life. So the life that God missed in Eden. Was found in Jesus. in Jesus. That's life. That thing that God was in there when they hurt you, it was when Jesus came that we got it back. Now, so in trying to understand life, instruction is your life, what is this life? Now, in looking into these things, you will see that when God said that they would die, that life would go away from them, what God was saying would go away from them, what is the biological life? What would go away from them, was actually what Jesus came to restore back. Now, to understand what Jesus came to restore, I want you to look at it. Jesus also said that still, would you ever believe we have eternal life? In John 10.10, he said, the sea cometh not but to steal, to kill and to destroy. But I have come that the earth might have life and that life abundantly. So, Jesus came to give back the life that was lost in Eden. So, it means to understand when we are talking about life, we need to now understand, what really happened when the life went? When he says instruction is your life, we need to understand, when that life is taken, what is it that would be missing? To be able to appreciate what would be missing, is to properly understand the ministry of Jesus Christ. Because he was the one that came to give, to give back that life. So, what exactly comes into eternal life? We can better appreciate things, by what Jesus came to give us back, by looking at Isaiah chapter 23. Isaiah chapter 23. Let's look at Isaiah 23. A baby was trying to understand, this matter of life. Isaiah chapter 23. Look at what the Bible says, talking about Jesus Christ. The Bible says, Who has believed our report? I'm reading from verse one. And to whom has the hand of the Lord been revealed? For he will grow up before him at the tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground. He has no foe nor comeliness. And when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. Talking about Jesus Christ. Now, he was despised and rejected by men. A man of sorrow acquainted with grief. And we hide, as it were, our faces from him. He was despised, and we did not esteem him. Now, from verse four. Please follow this too, from verse four. Surely he bore our grief. Now, I'm going to make you understand, what life is. What life is. What Jesus came and to offer us in exchange for our death. Is the best way to know what actually life is. What Jesus gave to us. What Jesus made available. When he said, I have come that they may have life. What are those things that he made available for us. The more you can understand the things that Jesus made available. And when he said, I have come that you may have life. The more you can comprehend what the bible meant. What the bible says. Look, instruction is your life. Because what took that life away from them, was that, Adam and Eve let go of instruction. You are letting go of instruction. I want to let you know what you are inviting. When you say that, instruction is your life. Huh? What you are letting go, the life that you are letting go, I want to amplify it for you. What you are inviting, when you allow instruction to go. When you allow life to go. When Adam allows life to go, and he was dead. He became biologically, he became biologically alive. He became biologically alive. But, he became biologically alive. But, he was asked, he was eternally dead. What is it, that actually got missing? What are those things, that the death implies? What are those things, that is implied in that death? That is what we are trying to look at. That is what we are trying to survey, for us to understand. Now, we are looking at, the first thing, that left. The first thing that left, look at what Jesus said. Look at what the Bible says about Jesus. The Bible says, Surely, He bore our grief, and carried our sorrows. Look at what the Bible says about Jesus. The Bible says, instruction is your life. Every time you are allowing instruction to go, what you are getting in estates, and, number one, grief. Surely, when Adam allowed life to go, what came in estates for that life? When life left? When he allowed that instruction to go, and he became a dead man? Any time you allow instruction to go, what is coming in estates? The Bible says, instruction is your life. Don't let that go into your life. Either, number one, you are bringing grief. Number two, you are bringing sorrows. The Bible says, Surely, Jesus bore our grief. When you say, all who are disabled, any time we are walking outside instruction, what we are carrying with our life, what we are carrying are griefs. Things that will be for our griefs, and our sorrows. When you are allowing instruction to go, what you are getting in estates, are griefs. Number one, two, you are bringing sorrows. Surely, Jesus came. When he came, what he came to take away from us, that was our death. The death that we died. Number one, eh? They were griefs. Different type of griefs. Number two, he came to take our sorrows. What is embedded in life? Eh? Is actually, a joy, an absence of griefs. Number, number three, I've mentioned two. What is the life of instruction? When the Bible says, instruction is your life, what it meant is that, instruction is that, eh? Which is your joy. Eh? Your joy in life, your joy is instruction. The absence of griefs, are instruction. When you say this is your life, absence of griefs, eh? are sorrow. Eh? They are the, they are the, eh? Episcopations. We want to demonstrate what death is. Number one, griefs. Number two, sorrows. Eh? And, what is, you know, encapsulated in death? What is inside death? And what is inside life? Is what I'm bringing out one by one. What is inside life? Is joy, and absence of sorrow. When man dies, what came upon man, were griefs, and sorrows. Instruction is the source of your joy, and absence of your griefs. When you go on, eh? He said, but he was wounded, eh? For our transgression. He was bruised for our iniquity. So, for our living instruction. When we learn instruction, Jesus was bruised for it. He was wounded for it. So, when he was being bruised, when he was being wounded, what is it that he was buying for us? What was he restoring back to us? Eh? The Bible says, the chastisement for our peace is upon him. When the Bible says, instruction is your life. What the Bible means, eh? Is that, instruction is your peace. Instruction is your peace. Instruction is your joy. Instruction is the absence of grief. Instruction is your peace. Your peace is inside instruction. When God wants to give you peace, God passes the peace as instruction. When God intends to give you joy, God passes it as instruction. When God wants to take grief away from your life, God passes it as instruction. So, when you let instruction go, once you are allowed to go, eh? Because you have allowed your peace to go. You have allowed your joy to go. You have allowed, eh? Your absence of grief to go. You have invited restlessness. You have invited sorrows. You have invited grief. That is not all. That is not all. He said, the chastisement of our peace is upon Him. And by His chastisement, we will heal. By His chastisement, we will heal. By His chastisement, we will heal. Are you getting that? When you allow instructions to go, what you are inviting is God. Eh? It is all manner of sickness. All manner of His health. All manner of His health. Eh? When God talks about sickness, don't just be thinking of presence of the individual. Eh? When God talks about by His chastisement, we will heal. Eh? That healing was restored. What is restored? Eh? It is not just the absence of ailments. Absence of disease. We will talk about health. Eh? There is psychological health. There is mental health. Eh? Emotional health. There is physical health. There is physical health. There is social health. Health. Health. Covered virtually every, Covered virtually every, almost every area of your life. almost every area of your life. Eh? When He says by His chastisement, we will heal. That is why you notice in 1 John 3. That is why you notice in 1 John 3. He said, I would that you prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers. Eh? What I'm trying to make you see is that embedded in life, embedded in life, eh? is also health. Jesus Christ died and by that He said He brought back healing to heal us from that vast kind of ailment. The ailment could be spiritual. The ailment could be spiritual. It could be psychological. It could be emotional. It could be mental. It could be physical. Eh? So when we are talking about life, So when we are talking about life, why are we talking about aspects of all kinds of ailments? aspects of all kinds of ailments? Emotional one, psychological one, mental one, physical one, just with details, it's almost endless. Destruction is your life. So, the point I'm making this morning So, the point I'm making this morning is that why does anybody have to say take first hold of destruction? is that why does anybody have to say take first hold of destruction? It's because he inherits in that instruction he inherits in that instruction when he says life, when he says life, life. We are talking about absence of grief. absence of grief. We are talking about the presence of joy. the presence of joy. We are talking about a a We are talking about the presence of penis, penis, ephokobale. We are talking about the aspect of hayman, the aspects of every kind of he-hair, that is life, that is life. So I want to make you see why the Bible therefore says, look, you must let ah go, don't let instruction go. Don't allow instruction to go, are the things that would have been gone. By the time you allow instruction to go. Don't allow instructions to go. Never never never never never never never never ever never never never never never Because once it goes, these four things are gone, you will notice. Let's see how this played out in the Garden of Eden and then we close the meeting for today. Let's see how this matter played out in the Garden of Eden, Genesis Chapter 3. Let's see how the matter played out in Genesis 3 after they ate the fruit. From verse 6, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree was able to make one wife, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband's hand and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew they were naked. And they still fit together and made themselves cover. And they heard the sound of the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord among the trees of the garden. Are you seeing something here? When death came, there was nakedness. We will not be discreet. We will not be naked. When death came, there was nakedness. I'm talking about grace. I'm talking about soul. I'm talking about absence of peace. I'm talking about being heard in the absence of instruction. When you are looking at what is happening, you will feel there is no instruction to be. You see what's there? Nakedness. You see what's there? Fear. Nakedness. Fear. Trembling. Ising. They were no more at peace. They were no more at peace. They were no more at rest. Why? They have allowed instruction to go. And because instruction left, of course, what will be coming in now will be the things that are the mark of death. The things that are implied in death. When God said to him, we die. What God meant is you will become naked. And what God meant is fear and sorrow will be there. Fear will come. Sorrow will come. And he called him. And then he said I was naked and whatever. And then why did you eat and all of that. What followed? Then accusation. The woman. Disappearance. Instead justification that does not allow many people to have peace in their marriages today. You don't want to see how you are wrong. You are only concerned with how your partner is wrong. How you are wrong is not important to you. What is important to you is how your partner is wrong. It is the woman. It is the serpent. It is this. You don't want to see where you are wrong. Eh? All of these are consequences of death. They are consequences of death. And so, it is very, very important for us to see how it plays out. Huh? Look at the sorrow of the woman. Oh! This serpent deceives me. Oh! Oh! Maybe you don't have regret. Look at the regret that is now happening. Regret. I am talking about sorrow. I am talking about grief. I am talking about absence of peace. I am talking about an absence of good health. Look at what played out today. Huh? Enemies. Enemies. Enemies. Different enemies. Here and there. Enemies. Between the spirit and the spirit. And between the spirit. And between the spirit. I will multiply your sorrows, sorrows and conceptions, you will try to rule your husband but he will go to matai you, strive, strive to demand, cause him the ground for your taking. It will not bring you again only food, it will bring tongues and teethes. And out of your sweat, labouring to eat because somebody, somewhere compromised instructions. So please, I want you to bear in mind. Every time you allow instructions to go, it is these four things that are leaving your life. What you are inviting, what the Bible says, you will die. When you lie, the lie that is in the instructions is those four things. Inside the instructions God gives you. Why you must not allow the instructions to go? Because inside that instructions, are the things that God gives you. Why? In the absence of your grief. Inside that instruction is your joy. Inside that instruction is your peace. Inside that instruction is for you to be in health, to prosper and be in health. That is why instruction is your life. That is why instruction is your life. I pray for you this morning, wherever you are listening to me. You will not be naked. Adam and Eve became naked. When we leave instruction, we become naked. You know what has gone from your life? Joy is gone. Peace is gone. You have invited sorrow and grief. You have invited inability to prosper. You have invited, yes. You have invited all manners of in-health. Emotional in-health. Mental in-health. Psychological in-health. Those are the things you have invited. You have become naked. May you not be naked. I pray for you young man, young woman listening to me. Wherever you are this morning. Please take part in your instruction. Don't let the instruction the Lord gives you. Don't let the instruction from his word. And those things he tells you in your devotion. In your quiet time. By way of inspiration. By way of revelation. By way of instruction. By way of listening to his word. By way of hearing his word. The instruction that comes to your heart. The instruction guiding your heart. Don't let it go. Don't let provocation. Deception. And prayer help you to live instruction. Because once you allow instruction to go. Your life is gone. Your joy is gone. Your peace is gone. You have invited. You have invited sorrow. You have invited grief. You have invited calamity. You have invited inond careful struggle. It is true. It is true. But it is also true that here is your struggle. That is the struggle. Where did instruction go? That is what you are allowed to go. You have become wicked! Ask the close this morning, wherever you are. One morning before we close. Huh? I don't know.

God greatly desires a godly home for them. These are words of restoration and instruction and righteousness from Family Tech Ministry. May you be blessed as in this year. We said everybody live a long fulfilled life. Long fulfilled life simply means that you have fulfilled your purpose. Once your purpose has expired, then your life is fulfilled. People think of long life in the terms of the way you count calendar years. I always say, okay, I'll go for school for two semesters and I'll do it until 11. Two semesters is not 24 months. I'm already in second year. That second year is not 12 months. Do you understand me? It can be seven months. So if you say to me, a semester, then a year is over. You move to the next year. You don't actually mean 12 calendar months. Is that not? So when we say God grant us fulfilled life, that God grant us to live into full old age and to fulfill our days, we are the one counting calendar. What God is counting is, the purpose He has for your life and whether that purpose is finished. Once the purpose is finished, then your life is fulfilled. You don't have to live a fulfilled long life. And I was one after the three. We say Jesus died on timely death. Jesus died on timely death. Jesus died on timely. It was not on timely. It was not on timely. It was a timely death. Why? He simply said that... What was the statement on the cross? It was true with the woman. So if you waste further, we just... What will you be doing? Living for himself? When there's no more forces to do? There's nothing they get to do. That's how we should look at life. As long as God is granting you life, even because, God likes me, that's why I live longer than somebody. You see, because our purpose is different. The purpose that determines everything. You know, you know, you know this thing. And I gave a very practical example with plants. If you plant tomatoes, beans, and, let's take cassava. Then you also have coconuts. If you plant the three of them at the same time, what will happen over time? In three months, tomatoes, will have fully matured. It's not true. It would have harvested tomatoes. But as we continue, after about, towards the end of one year, you will pluck and pluck and pluck, and then the thing will grow. But if you pick something like coconuts, by the time that one life is expiring, coconuts have not started yet. It's still growing. So it's not because coconuts have a longer life, than, than, tomatoes. It's because its own purpose, and its own making is deeper. If you have a coconut after one year, you won't get anything inside coconuts. So leaving it, allowing it to keep growing on, is not because you love it more than the tomatoes. It's just that, for its own making, as at a year, it is still growing. So you still leave it to be growing. And if you leave tomatoes after one year, it will be happening to the tomatoes. What will be happening to the tomatoes? It starts getting bad. It does. And so let's understand this issue of long life, you know, from the point of purpose. It gives us enough of rest. And that is why, it comes as an assumption that last month, it comes as very important, huh, for us on a daily basis, to keep, doing everything to understand purpose. Because the more you understand purpose, the more you know how long, or how short, you have to live. But if you are not understanding purpose, and are just pursuing several things, eh, then suddenly you are cut off. But go and look at men who have followed purpose. Go and check all of them. Look at Paul. He said, I have fought a good fight. I have kept this faith. Is that not true? Now there remains for me something, something, something. You got to go following it. So when you are about to kill him, you are not saying, please pray, that God will deliver me from this place. Because he knew that there was no need for deliverance. I have fought a good fight. I have kept this faith. Now there remains for me something. I am about to be offered. So he was willing to go, because he knew the purpose was finished. You see, it is because we are living for something else today. That is why, look at him, suddenly we are cut off. But if you are not following purpose, Jesus, when the time was coming, how did he tell Judah, what you are doing? Too quickly. He knows, okay. And then when he was going, he said, now is your time. It is time on darkness. Huh? Pilate wanted to save him. He said, look, you don't even have power over me. Huh? I will put my life on the line. He took me. Because we are following purpose. And I tell people, if we begin to live correctly, I begin to follow what is purpose. I begin to understand it. I begin to live for it. I begin to follow it. The more you understand it, the more you know, the more you know, okay, this thing needs to be done. By the time, when I will be finishing, you will be knowing that very soon I will be going. It makes life a lot meaningful unlike just living for ourselves. And, I am saying, I am giving all of this background because today's topic is a reflection on Psalm 139. It is actually a follow up to our discussion last night. So, that is what I am trying to recall. I am trying to last, I am trying say. If I have missed an order from the Disciples, I should probably read it once more. This is all. But the thing it is that we are talking about right now is that it is always included in our life. Now, what we need on the Lord's path is the life of Jesus Christ. The prayer of Jesus Christ is indicated inaudible cr. texts, Listen to what he was saying. Before going to church, I keep looking for answers, but there are too many less than what I do. It means, everything I have done for myself today As we move to Psalm 139. We will look at, it's a very very familiar scripture and we will try all the translations that we have here for each today. Now, let's go to Psalm 139. I'm having your kingdom. You're having the message down. O-R. Okay. Separate translation. Okay. And who is having N-I-V? N-I-V. Good. So you have message, energy, and amplify. I think we should be okay with this translation. That we have with us now. So let's see Psalm 139. The topic is a reflection on Psalm 139. In brackets, what ought to be a Christian outlook to life. What ought to be a Christian outlook to life. Psalm 139. We'll begin from verse 1. But the verse of empathy, of empathy, we will try separate translations with them. It says, O Lord, you have searched me and known me. O Lord, you have searched me and known me. So for God to know us, what does God do? Like the church in this town. So what does God do to know us? He searches. Why would God need to search us? Why would God need to search us? Because He can know us. He knows our church here. Are you understanding me? Hmm? Jeremiah 17. That's nice. Somebody should just read that for us. Say, O Lord, you have searched me. You have searched me. Who is Jeremiah 17 for us? That's nice. The heart is the truth for above all things. The heart is the truth for above all things. It is beyond fear. Who can understand it? I, the Lord, stretch the heart. And examine the mind. To reward each person according to their conduct. To reward each person according to their conduct. According to what their deeds desire. Are you getting something? The heart is deceitful. And sincerity is uncarryable. Only God can cure the heart. ഉഉཉཔ ഉཌྷཥཇ� profitable, Le'we say, who can know it? Le'we say, I THE LOVES, I search the earth. I try the motives, I try the ways, I try it. So, I will now reward every man according to his ways. So, where is the ways of a man? Where is the ways of a man? In the heart, in the rare industries. in the motive behind, the motive in the heart. You understand me? You know you can be doing something. Even the actual motive, you don't even know it. Ok, later, after you've done it, you don't look very well at the truth, that this is the real thing, no? I remember I listened to a young man one day, who had tried medicine three or four times, and could not get medicine. And I said, why not go to another course? Then we would normally go together for a spiritual fellowship, evangelism to the sick. He said, it's because he has been in the hospital, and he just sees that he can become a medical doctor, this evangelism will be able to do it much more better. I said, that is wrong. I said, the motive is, what you are saying is ok, but the way you are looking at it is not correct. It is God that determines where He puts us. You are not the one that chooses where we will be found. God is not asking for your blessing. You are not thinking that because you are doing your spiritual evangelism, God will make you a doctor. He is not saying that. He said to me, that is true too. He said, that is true. He said, for you to know, it is a decision to be a doctor. Are you following something? You see, one's look at what he is pretending to God, so that I can now reveal submission. But having been asked, but that having been, having been, you know, you know, taken out of the way, he was not able to see himself. And you know, he made that statement. He just said, ok, I don't know what answer to give again. You know, I am talking of something now that happened in the, I am talking of 88, 89, you know. But you know, I got home that day, slept, as I woke up very early in the morning, the Lord just called my attention. You see that morning on the night, the Lord called my attention. He said, well, he said, as for him, referring to the brother we discussed together, he said, I will withhold him from mercy to hide his soul from pride. I said, oh, that is why he is crying and crying and crying but he will never get it. Oh, so if he gets it, he will become proud. Wow. I didn't tell him anything. I just washed it off. He tried and tried. He didn't get it. He went to necropology. He was so concerned with necropology. But then he said, even when, I have not discussed it with him. But the point I am trying to bring out is that God, He was saying something. Huh? In the moment of defeat, you see, God said, Oh, I love you Jesus. Oh, I love you. God will not be moved by that. He goes to flesh. He will just be doing that because he wants sympathy for people like him. If you see the way that sister cries, that may be the motive. You see, man is complex. He is so complex that even when he is presenting a sacrifice to God, God has to look beyond the presentation and go and check the race. Go and check the motive. Huh? And you know, that's what I was telling somebody. You know, you notice every time I speak, I keep coming back to relationship and marriage because that's one area God has called us into. That's what I was telling somebody. Instead you look at your sister or your brother, he is acting in fellowship. He is like 2 by 3 by 4 by 5. Huh? He must be good. God normally flesh. He is acting in fellowship. He is speaking in tongues. He is doing that. He is this. He does not make anything. Because what is even presenting it to God? God himself is searching to know the person's ways. Huh? You know, that's what I was telling somebody. Huh? You that cannot see beyond the physical thing. That cannot see anything because it's 2 by 3 by 5. It's from your village. A red mansion. And so, in fact, the brother is quiet. No more thing about him. See that it's night. Huh? You don't understand this matter. You don't know man. I was talking with a lady about this matter. She said, he is going to go out. I said, so have you prayed about it? She said, yes. I said, he has prayed. She said, but you know sir, no more thing about this young man. She said, he is so caring. He is so caring sir. I looked at the lady. I looked at her. I looked at her. You know. And having done that, I just answered her. You know what I told her? Because she is not really, she is not really so young. She is not 27, 28. I said, look. My sister. She said, a man can do anything. Huh? When he is still pursuing. And having obtained the object of his pursuit, he regards that to himself. You can't say a man is caring. Huh? Because he is pursuing you with this man. You can't say so. You can't say so. And he said, okay, okay. You don't know that he is nice. After some time, he said, because he said, he has said something. He said, sir, he says that I need to be pregnant for him before the marriage can be contracted. I said, but he said it is nice. And that is caring. He said, but you don't even understand it yet. I looked at him. He is so emotional. He said, God, You have searched me and You have known me. What I want you to understand in your life is that God searches us and He knows us. He says, don't think God don't know you. Don't ever think that God don't know you. He knows you true and true. He understands your tendencies. he knows your inclinations even when sometimes you seem to do something that look very spiritual if it is not he knows he knows the first thing i'm showing you how to reflect on 139 is that you start open with something that is so serious he said oh lord you have searched me and you know me you have searched me god daily searches us he daily tries our motives he tries he tries us in different ways he do different things to search our ways can i show you somebody in the bible that god did that for remember abraham when god noticed the interaction between him and and isaac and interaction was becoming one of those many things i don't have the convenient relationship with that one your only song suppose the ocean is your song even though they both came out of him he said your only son that's what i think we will go and kill god just wanted to fish i'm sure you said and god was watching he wanted to see what would happen and you know what i could carry the boys and then what's doing was good he was he was setting the thoughts he was certainly in there i think god says you kill him what else should i do he came from god and god wants him what will happen to my future god knows all those thoughts baba is following them he was following them he was following them and then the man got there kind of denied and then and god said i'm going to kill back the death of the boy now i know that he fears so look in blessing so he says he knows him you may just be inside the example come on just a great breath big small brief on that time and then the prince just come and then you could not remember what you read okay কেরার ত্যার িনে বেলে কোঃ Morning 1 – 6, 1994. I don't believe God. I don't believe God. And he says, ah, this is my final example. When I fail, but I believe God will return. I can't fail. Second semester, 500 level. Second level, second level, number two. And if he's afraid that the new intelligence will come to his task force, he'll look around, look at his number, trust me, go to him, go to him. Even God will be surprised at that. Why is he calling us? Because he's not afraid of that. I don't have that in me. But all of that, what was God doing? Huh? To see. Huh? What the person will choose. Whether I say this, or I say this. He just wanted to see. You see, God searches with different things. That's what Moses could do. You know. Certain times, situations, God will just throw one thing. Just to see. He said, Lord, you have searched me. And you have known me. He just brought me from there. And then you guys, you present our papers and everything, and everything, and everything. And to this man, he said, no, no, you cannot go. You must do this. I said, no, no. Can't you just tell this man like before you? God, you just saw shit. I mean, different circumstances to test us and to know us. People don't know that God test me. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. God test men. And that's why I teach you to be black. To make you see that God do search men. Wanting to know what are they fearing. Wanting to know what and who they will choose. In certain situations. And based on his evaluation of the life. He knows what to commit to him. And what not to commit to him. You have searched me. You have known me. You are the setting of someone's at night. Lord, You have searched me. And you have known me. The first thing I'm trying to make you see as we reflect on this matter. Is that the Lord searcheth us. And the Lord knows us. In different way. At different times. With different things. He searcheth us. He knows us. And just to tell you how the Lord did that searching and knowing. Is everything you find from the verse 2. He says. You know my sitting down and my rising up. It's only a summary of that verse 1. I'm going to tell you this. Huh? You know my sitting up. You know my sitting down and my rising up. You understand. You understand my thoughts are far off. You comprehend my paths and my lying down. And are acquainted with all my ways. Can we try that with another translation? That the last sentence in verse 3. And you are acquainted with all my ways. Can we take it in alphabet? Oh. He is off. Okay. Energy. Energy. Yes. Part of verse 3. You are familiar with all my ways. Other translation? Energy. Energy. You know many things I do. You does what? You know things. That I do. Three things that I do. You know it. You know everything that I do. Now. I hope you see that. It's just a matter of giving that verse 1. I only showed you verse 1. How God gets to know everything that we do. He checks it off. He tried off. He tried it in. He tried it. He checked it. He looked at it. He put it on. And on and on. He tried to see what could be there. And he tried to look at it. He look at it through and through. He leave us to ourselves. Go and tell Hezekiah. What did God left me. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. I said. For there is not a word on my tongue, but you know it all together. Is that not true? You have urged me behind and before, and laid your hands upon me. That is the third thing. Can we see somebody that God urged him behind and before? Can we see somebody that God urged him behind and before? He wanted to try them to know them. We saw it in Abraham. But there is another one again in the scripture. That God urged them both ways. And God was watching to see what will happen. Huh? That's another very good one. God urged him in. He laid his hand on him. He said, go. Go and take a break. Let's see. And take them away. Huh? In a single day. Ten children. Eleven thousand livestock. Vroom! And God was watching. Let's see. Let's see. That is a serious urging. When you urge him, when you urge him here, and you lay behind on him to see what will happen. Huh? You know, when you drink anything under pressure, if you press orange, and you press orange, and you press orange, when you etch orange in, what will happen to orange? Orange will burst. And then if he gives you what? Mango juice. What will he give you? So, when you etch in, you etch in and etch in. You etch in and etch in. You etch in. What will you do? Eh? What's happened? It brings out what is inside. So, pressure don't make us what we are not. It brings out what is not. That's how sometimes God will edge your things. He will edge us, edge us, edge you, and see what you will do under pressure. And you say, ah, actually I don't want to do it. It was because my papa or father got me what he wanted. It's just to bring out what is inside. You see, you have edged me in. me in out here to lay your hand on me i'm showing you how god what god does to do us you can pick the three blue boys also how god eggs them in on one hand fire hit it seven times tie them put them inside and god will force you and as he was telling them he was watching i think nothing will happen hey no you see what i shall look like i didn't show until they were inside the fight so inside the fire god said wow the award and then he showed up in the fire that's why sometimes god don't god don't believe back of eh from god deliver us in you waited because it's edging you in it won't deliver you from something it will deliver you in the thing and it's a wealth edging you in edging you in edging you in to see what you will do it will still show up what you want to show up inside and that's why i show you that of the exam give them no small hair just a small breeze on the sister or the brother and the brother just for god the wine over there no this is over divine no i've never done it before situation and the day will not come you believe that i can deliver me i can't remember you have just said i can't try to draw your attention that can't be salvation it's another thing blueback ah oh thank you jesus you know what i tell you to keep the work my body is true you know what i tell you to keep the work my body is true you know what i tell you to keep the work my body is true just taking you just edging you in don't you see that my phone oh my i'm telling you that god first man to know how to place them and nobody nobody suddenly take men to work and every course know what is the capacity of every person tell that person bring bring the colleague colleague will do well here he knows which one nobody takes so just into him you can't be sure of the quality and the work of who they are so i'm showing you god he said you have sex with me and i'm telling you different way we feel god touches us today what does that make you feel okay many times people don't realize that in him we live in him we move in him we have power people think god is so far away out there god is constantly around with us he's dead he's you know god is not he's not one person that is watching from afar and that is that is he's just going through judgments that hearing case look out he's part of the case was that of the original Estado y ha sido parte del Cilento he's dead he didn't die so that's the thing del Sol está parte del sistema there you see god you see what i was trying to do it was not it was part of the whole thing when you were doing it you just don't take your own judgment you you had just in different ways at different times you know i can give you practically example as a student of sin god that i remember like i can't have said this one since i put it flat i wrote an exam um fcc 211 and buzzer 211 they are both 211. by the time i come back to check my results channel i will face the next time they said no result but i know i wrote the exam they just looked at me i went everywhere i went i went up and down did everything they said they could not find the result i don't know that i don't know that i don't know what to do my research nothing like internet so what you do is that if you don't complete the particular and the best you can do is to please add and drop some if you are not sure of the results you click you add it then by the following time you will drop it to visit and go for what you are not sure of so by the time this letter was going in i had to pick up and drop from still wanted but god this result i was doing this and people now called me they are ah oh you only you are not serious this is your pastor this script they will be in the script room you are going to that member two plus times now give him something he will go to set the script rules and he will bring out your script give him something to go and take this to work you let me write your life i was like my son but i just went and then for something the morning of the following day one of something just came to mind as it was so strong that morning out of the strong to come out sweetness out of the ether will comfort me i just began throughout the day out of the song we call my sweetness out of the ether will comfort me i said no out of the show we call my fitness as i was saying that thing over and over and over again over and over and over again i think by the following day i didn't know what courage came upon me i just went to the lecture that i've been going to all this while that was just sending me up i don't want to miss him because i took the call i said i wrote this exam and they're telling me missing a result people have been fending me i mean okay that's the sociology so the thing we're not even in the script room if i break the math nothing would have come up you know okay i thought if i can read it i'm not just saying i don't saw myself a car i bought my car yeah and you did well fine b take it to your department huh i left this i took money second one I guess I don't use exam, and they know there's no result. So then, see this script I hear, just come and search, come and search. I go back to sociology, I go back to sociology, I did not see it. Suddenly, somebody just say carry that pack. I go back with accounting or business pack. Say carry that pack. I went and carry the pack. The first script on it was my script. So they missed it all. That's why they couldn't find my result. I say, sir, see the, that is like, I say, yes, but today you saw a script, sir. Say, okay, okay, okay, just sign again. I'm going to, I'm going to tell you, don't assign it to a program. Eh? God just wanted to see, eh, what would you do? You see, I'm saying, I'm saying this edgy aim. If you are edgy aim, you are edgy aim here and there. If you clearly of it, this is the compromise we do, eh, they cut us short of placement. Indeed. This little compromise we do here and there, they cut us short of placement. You will think, eh, that's not good. Let us, let us, let us learn to rest on the Lord. We are looking at, we are, the topic is a little bit different than what I want at night. Then the bracket is what ought to be a Christian outlook to life? What should be our outlook? I was just looking at what should be our outlook to, to life? That's what we're searching. So you are reading, you are, you are, you are reading, and here you have read your hand, you have laid your hand on me. There's this, see, such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is I, I cannot attain it. Eh? I hope you know what it's trying to say. That the way God knows him, is such that he's so wonderful, that he himself cannot know himself the way God knows him. You get the point I'm making? Because he doesn't search himself. For example, here I'm telling you now, you know you'll be wondering, eh, who was even trying to know me? So, are you saying that even where we attend, we don't know attend the way God knows us? That's why I say, the way you know me is even too much. But you say, go to that dimension, on this matter. This is the third dimension to it. Searching and knowing. You say, you know I said, I haven't said that. You know, we're now extrapolating some things that we can just reach through together. You know, can we, you take your Bible, seven translations, let us read it together. From verse seven. Where can I go from your spirit? Or where can I flee from your presence? If I ascend into heaven, you are where? You are there. If I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there. If I take the wings of the morning, and go in the uttermost part of the sea, even there, your hand shall lead me. And your right hand shall hold me. If I say, surely the darkness shall follow me. Even the night shall be light about me. Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from you. But night shines at day. The darkness and light are both alike to you. Are you seeing the extent to which this man raised the matter? He said, now I have now come to realize that there is no iota of me. There is no intricate details of me in terms of my doings that you don't know. And there is nothing I can do to hide anyone from you. What ought to be a Christian perspective to life? What ought to be a Christian perspective to life? In the person of the one that's in life. What ought to be a Christian perspective? You ought to be able to understand anything of these things. I can say that in terms of our actions and our doings. From verse 14, it now takes another dimension. From verse 14, it takes another dimension of this knowledge. It says, I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. It's not coming now. He has left what can be. What is it coming to now? What's he coming to now? Eh? The art of creation and foreknowledge. He has left our works and our deeds. That, God have all the details. He's now coming back to the art of creation. That's another dimension to God's knowledge. And in saying that, he said, look, when it's even come to creation, we are fearfully and wonderfully made. For those of us who have a little knowledge of biology, because of the course of study, do not even the fact that you are born is a miracle. Do you understand that? The chance with which you were born is one in a million chances. What I mean is that, your mom only gave an egg. Your dad received close to three million pounds. And only one of them will fertilize the egg. At the end of the day, it was you. That in itself is serious. You are just one in a million chances. It could have been somebody else. It could have been a female. It could have. It's just a chance. But God was only in that chance. That's what we want to go into now. That's why he said, even my making, I am fearfully and wonderfully made. If you put a million times to fertilize one egg, who can follow this one to fertilize the egg? I'm doing just a million. What I do is about three million. To manage a population. Now, if they are all traveling, everybody is moving at a chance. Just a random movement. Who can beat the one? Let us use one million. That will eventually be the one to fertilize the egg that they are rushing to make. And yet, at that point, God was pursuing the one that we need. David, when he was to use the sling, it was done at a chance. Who took the stone directly? David. David whatever distance away from his sling would bring no water. Doncs he said, David said, that the water was that big. Did you look carefully, did you see verse 45. He said it's like a good reverberation well, Good. Has it ever personified? The Lord should attack you. That's what you should understand. Situation and get magical oss. Do you consider yourself better than God? People who don't know God, disabled. I am showing you God in creation. I am showing you how God filled creation in a way that is amazing and awesome. Look at how Ahab was killed. Remember how Ahab was killed? Jehoshaphat came to visit Ahab. Prophets were gathered to prophesy. They were all saying the same thing. They went to call Micaiah. Are you familiar with that theory? Are you familiar? If you are familiar with Bible stories, even if you don't know the revelation, but know all the stories, if you don't know the Bible stories, then you have not done Bible appreciation. It is not a good thing. That is a condition that every Christian should do. Bible appreciation. There is no story in the Bible that you don't know. I don't mean you have all the revelations, but there should be no story, no Bible story that you don't know. You were not able to pick the chapter, the verse, but at least the book. At least with the story. In that story, they called, they now went to something. Is there no another prophet here? That was by Jehoshaphat. And they now said, there is still one. One stupid one like that. That will never tell any good thing. So they went to bring Micaiah. When Micaiah came, what did he say? He said, ah, you will win the battle and everything. And he said, oh, good man. For how long have I said, surely tell me the truth? He said, you want to hear the truth. Okay. I see Israel scattered like sheep with that shepherd. And then, they just shot the man, shot him. Hey look, the king is going to come back. He said, okay. He said, eh, if you go and you come back from this battle, then the Lord has lost control. They went for the battle. And when they went, what happened? You know, they changed their garments. They have worn the clothes of Jehoshaphat. Later on, they wore the clothes of Ahab. So when the archers saw Jehoshaphat, they pursued him. But from the way he was running, no, this is not Ahab. So they left that one. The Bible now says, go and check that story. Go to the Bible. Who knows what the Bible says? No, you know somebody just said, he said, if the Bible talks about how the arrow was shot, he said, no, the Bible says, no, the Bible says how the arrow was shot. What does the Bible say about how the arrow was shot? Please, go and check it yourself. The Bible says, and a man shot a arrow at a venture. That is, okay, the arrow is okay. He just shot it at a venture, at a chance. He just shot the arrow. He said, and the arrow, eh, the arrow was shot at a great distance. The arrow was shot at the last moment. Had this man shot, he was shot by the arrow. The arrow was shot. That is, the arrow was shot by the arrow. The arrow was shot by the arrow. He shot the arrow. And the arrow was shot by the arrow. And the arrow was shot by the arrow. That is, it was not targeted. Who changed the direction? Your father released the arrow at a venture. God's... Baba was targeting you with the gun. I am telling you a... I am telling you the Scripture. I am telling you the reflection of Psalm 139. I take a point in my heart. I began to, I began to fear God. It is the way God knows us. The intricacy, the detail. You will not see how the thing will come back at the end. But for you the intricacy, the detail. My body will die. Boy again. Before they do boy again, my body will die. It is going to be a boy. And it is going to be a girl. All that he had programmed and he had determined. And he was following the intention. When the ancestors were running too much, they breath, put them this way, let the white go. As long as I am living. And like that, like that, he wants a nation. Or he wants a few nations. All of these will be God's. Now, he says, I am faithfully and wonderfully made. People might make it. And I am showing you this making. That you are one in a million. One has to give a million. But you are one in a million chances. So even from birth, there has been a race about your life. And you are that person that came out. But you look like a chance. It was not a chance. It was a deliberate choice. Now, he says, my flame was not hidden from you when I was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the lower task. Else, where they were putting the flame? How your bone will be? The size of your skeleton? The way it will be? Every inch? Every inch? Who was busy working? So, are you seeing the indicator of the detail? Now, he says, your eyes saw my substance being yet unformed. He didn't say your eyes saw the substance. He saw my being yet unformed. Now, what do you see that is not completed? He says, and in your books. They were written. The destruction for me was as yet there was none of them. Job 14, verse 1 and 2. Job 14, verse 1 and 2. Job 14, verse 1 and 2. Job 14, verse 1 and 2. Man born of a woman. Somebody please follow. Job 14. Job. Man who is born of woman. Okay, I need a particular comparison. Okay, we'll get that. Okay, we'll still take the message. Yes? Read on. Man who is born of woman. He's a few days and full of trouble. He's a few days and full of trouble. Please, follow what it's reading. He comes forth like a flower and takes a root. He flees like a shadow and does not continue. And do you open your eyes and search for one? And bring him to judgment with a third? Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one. He's a few days and full of trouble. Please, what is the time? His day. What is the time? It's the tenth. Not only the day. Move on. The number of his month is the third. The number of the month has been worse, has been fixed. So what's the account for this read on? You have appointed his limit. You have appointed his limit. So that he cannot pass. He cannot pass it.

What type of life are you living? You are living a time's life. Time's life. Time's the life you are living. That's what I'm showing you again. That was Psalm 139. It says that, it says, you know, and in your book, they were written, the dead fashioned for me, when as yet there was none of them. None of them. When as yet there was none. None of them. The days, the months, they have been fixed. All those things have been worked out. The intricacies and the duties. They have been worked out. Huh? You know what I'm trying to make you feel? What did God tell Jeremiah? Jeremiah chapter 1. He said, before you were born, before you were born, I knew you. To be a what? A prophet. So, are you seeing that there is ordination? There is purpose by determining the number of days that you are fashioned to be a prophet. Based on the purpose, it will be so-so days, so-so months. For this one, it will be so-so days, so-so months. And that's why they were fashioned. So it has nothing to do with, you see, because God loves me more. A person who will live 20 years. That is... Place those things beside you. Place those things one way. Eh? Because that is not where the fullness of life is. You forget what it means to have fullness of life. What I'm trying to make you see, eh? Is this matter of the intricacies. How intricate! And if you want to expand this intricacy, if you look at Ephesians chapter 1 verse, what did God say about Christen? He said, just as the other ones. As he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world. So when were you chosen in Christ? Your father was still in the grave. All of them were still inside Adam. When God already saw you as a person, and he chose you, and you are saying that there is no intricacy in this matter. So there are no details. That's why when somebody wrote something on the internet, and everybody was collecting it, I just laughed. He said people are talking about, people are talking about the will of God, the will of God, the perfect will of God, the permitting will of God. He said there is nothing like all of these things. He said what is important is, you know, God's ultimate decision, will. His ultimate decision and his will. He said for example, God wants us, God wants us as Christians to have a happy youth. That is his will. I will get there, does not concern God. His will is that we should be happy in our marriage. So whether you see somebody you like that you chose, or you see somebody, as long as you are happy in your marriage, that is the will of God. I shook my head. And he went on and said so many things like that. He said what is important, people pay too much attention on the process. That God is going to send it in the process. What God is going to send is the ultimate thing, what eventually comes out. He said for example, God wants us to be healthy. How you get there does not matter. It's just that you are healthy. And he went on and gave several examples. And he said in that case, we can try to extrapolate it. And God could have also said, it means Jesus too was very very foolish. All God wanted him to do was to die. He should not have died the way he died. He could have died more honorably. He said so. See, God is going ahead in how it happens. Because when he said that he will die, we die. I did. So, he said he should not die. Whether, he said if you cannot use our wisdom, assume something well. Many things we go through, will not go through you. Because all God wants is that what just will happen in our marriage. We are talking about choice in marriage actually. He said okay. So, if Jesus had been very very wise, he should have as much do that. He could have waited till about it's the 100th year, live and marry, all God want that is that he die. Is that not? Taking that with him. Time I responded back to the matter, you know, people were able to get what I was trying to say that, look, bitch, who is all this issue that is coming out to me? God has intricate details of our lives. And that is why I tell somebody, I will never copy anybody. I am too significant, eh, to be a photocopy of somebody. I want to be myself. Because there are no two me. I want to be myself. I want to be myself. I don't want to be somebody else. I want to be what God wants me to be. Simple. Simple want to be. Because what God wants me to be, is unique and significant. Within the contract Jesus has made. Why I am saying this, is that we should look at this matter, we are looking at the Christian perspective to life. That, see, the matter is that, you know, God, the, not only does God know our work and our ways, it was that, the fact was that, people from where you are being formed, and how you are formed, into what you are formed, that's your personality. That's your person. The way you are. Eh, if you can, if you can, if you can, if you can do everything to remove the virus, you know, the virus is sin. If you remove the virus, you remove sin, self, and the world, from that your personality is a glorious one. All you need to remove from your personality is to say, me, an inquired person. They say, if you are quiet, that you are not a good person. It's a lie. That quietness, all you need to remove from it, is sin, self, and the world. God needs you that way you are. It's not the talking type. That way you are. God needs you that way you are. Don't try, listen to me, well, let's laugh. Let me tell you, let's laugh. Like, you don't be yourself. You don't even be yourself. And that's why, I don't have any special, whether I'm on puppets, or I'm talking, I talk the way I talk normally. Let's know now, you be present, when you look at the word of God. See the Bible, that is not me. The way I'm talking now, if you see that, that's the way I'm still talking. Just the way I am, is the way I can be significant. We need to understand this, and try to be ourself. You are important. You are definite. You are specific, at your making. The personality, the temperament, the taste, the way you were molded, is only that you were conceived in sin, because of the sin of Adam. So, there were virus infection. So, the program, you know, the virus, it's not that it infected the vine, but it infected the operating system. Do you understand me? So, the way the dream works, is not the way it's supposed to be working, because, it's the operating system that was, that was, that was attacked by the virus. Sin actually attacks the operating system. That's why Bible says, be transformed, by the renewal of your mind. The programming, the way you think, the way you feel life, your attitude, that is well seen as fact. And that's why you seem to be coming up with different programming, different things, because the operating system was affected. All you do is to remove the virus from your operating system. But it's not about changing our person. It's not about trying to copy somebody. It's not about, no. It's about the fact that you are specific and that you are important. And for you to know that I'm living a timed life. We are timed. And, the timing, you have been timed ever before you were born. You have been timed. The timing goes with a purpose. It goes with a purpose. There is a purpose. It is based on God's purpose that life will change. What He wants it for, what He wants to use it for. And your days, your days, they were written in His books. Eh? Your days. Eh? There is a will of God for every day. There is something God wants you to do daily. There is something about each day of your life. As God did each opening day, I wish you would get to stay with Him. To say, God, what will you have me do today? And He's not going to say, look, this needs to be done, that needs to be done, among other things that needed to be done that day. Because our days, they were wrote out. The point I'm trying to make you see, is that the Christian outlook to life, eh, is, is understanding Him. Eh? What I mean Him, I mean God. Understanding Him. Understanding His purpose. Understanding His intent. And working on it. That's the essence of life. Because it was timed, and it was programmed. And I tell people several, I keep saying it, and I will keep saying it. Eh? People plan their life, and ask God to bless it. Is that not what people do? They plan and plan, and ask God to bless it. But I tell people, you are living a wrong life. The correct way to live, eh, is to follow God's plan, and be blessed. Once you follow His plan, you are blessed. You don't need to plan your life, and ask God to bless it. You need to follow the plan. There is a plan. Once you are in that plan, you are blessed. You are blessed. You, yes, you know, you know, God will bless us with God. You are blessed with your spiritual blessings in Christ. We are blessed, people. But it is in the past. Once you come out of that past, eh, that's when you begin to struggle, and struggle. But in that past, you are blessed. Because your provision, your substance, that is why it is said, faith fills the kingdom of God. And in fact, you are saying, what will happen? They are there. They are in the, you know, it means other things are to be consequence of seeking something. Is that not? So, you are blessed. You are blessed. You are blessed. Is that not? There are supposed to be consequences. But what we are doing is that we are trying to plan our life and not asking God to bless it. But the Christian outlook is an understanding. Just look. You know my ways. You know my work because it's special. Number two, eh, you know my making. My making. You know my inclinations. You know my tendencies. You know my person. Eh, you were there when I was being formed in my mother's womb. Eh, you were there when I was being formed in my mother's womb. Eh, you programmed and formed me to be a man or a woman. Eh, you know why I was given to my father and my mother. That's why I tell people be careful with what you do to your father and your mother. Because you didn't choose any of them. Yes, you say. Honor father and mother that it may be well with you. There is something about that one from which you came out that has to do with the purpose. Even very few don't think about life. Eh, get out. Eh, you know. Be careful with some of these things that we do. Because many times we miss the awareness that ought to be our own. Say, honor father that it may be well. Honor them. What it means is that what is, you know, it doesn't make you say that we obey them in everything. Because, if for example your mother say go and commit fornication. What is saying is that respect. Eh, defer to regard them. Regard them. Not so much so much such that when they say things where it look at it. Eh, except one. You think it's against the higher authority. God. That's what they say. Ah, and even when you want to refute them it is to think with humility. Ah, I'm sorry. It will be difficult for me to What do you mean? I'm very sorry. What God is telling you is this. You are scoping. You are not. I say that is one thing you know you are saying. You are saying you are diffusing this. Yes, with honor. And not what is I should do? I should tell a lie that you are not happy. Who do you think I am? Do you know I am a child of God? You want to send me to hell? I am a child of God. You want to send me to hell? You want to send me to hell? Get it behind me Satan. That's not Christianity. That's not I tell you people that's not Christianity when you are dealing with father and mother. That's not Christianity. You will still not do it. But Jesus will take with honor. I say me please. I can't tell a lie. That's it. Please. I can't do this thing. You know. You know I'm a child of God. So, you may react and say no sir. I'm not able to do it. I'm so sorry sir. See the honor is there. That wound in which you are formed that made God to choose that one and God says honor father and mother and it will be well received. Because we don't place emphasis on these things today. That is why children have gone strange. People will be in school and they will be doing what they know as if their parents here their heart will be broken. And many times and many children have been destroyed that way. But just to get to school you say if my mother see me do this thing hey mommy will kill me. No. I can't. I can't do this. I can't stab my parents at the back. I can't do it. It will not be well with me. I can't do this. Do you know that once Saint Joshua and Joseph and brought him into the place of honor was that he was faithful to just his master. Ah! You are my master's wife. Because he said son you will honor your master. Ah! How will I sleep with my master's wife? How will I dishonor him? I will be sitting against God. I can't do it. And what did that do for you? Many destruction like it happened to children to the youth all of us. It is because they do things eh and at the same time with doing those things they are stabbing their parents behind. It will make up your mind that I will honor my mother and my father. If anything I do on campus it will save you from so many things. Can you sleep with a boy before your father and mother when you are not married to your father and when you are not married to him? Can you do it? You expect your parents are useless. They don't need they don't need to they don't need to pray for me before I have sex. I am going to have sex. You don't know why you are going to premarital sex. He says a man with father and mother if I forget father and mother I am going to have my own. I am telling you a man with father and mother is so properly understood. But a man he says I don't know what I am discussing I will just dive deeper into it. What I am trying to show you is that in that womb in which you were formed God chose the womb He formed you inside He took all the details He went through all those intricacies He selected He formed things and He put them together and He times the life based on that purpose and the Bible says thou hast created all things all the world for your pleasure God did create you for yourself He created you for your pleasure That's what He created you for and He designed you and He made you and He put you there and He wants you to come up and live that out So every time you are working in that thing for that program you know when you when you buy a radio and giving you okay Adaba wow breathe wow wow that my radio is BAM What is happening is having the purpose for which you bought it so every time you are having God's purpose you are giving Him pleasure you are making Him happy it's BAM it's BAM yeah the radio is working well no virus infection no round programming it's going on well and that is it a Christian perspective to life also to be the Christian perspective to life is to know that God is searching for us to know us and it's to know that God knows us and it's to know that God knows us intricately eh it says part 17 how precious also are your thoughts to me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they will be more in number than the sand when I wake up I am still with you please read that in the message part 17 and 18 this is the message 17 and 18 once again 17 and 18 please come again your thoughts how rare how rare how beautiful how beautiful God God I'll never comprehend them I cannot comprehend them you can move from the song yeah I couldn't even begin to count them I cannot even begin to count your thoughts any more than I could count the sand of the sea any more than I could count the sand of the sea oh let me rise in the morning okay and live always with you so let me rise in the morning and live always with you and listen the thought of please the thought of God and this is very very simple yeah what do you say if you look at cominth from in the end in the middle you say God is you say our God is the sun I have read about this before there is nothing good will say they are woke up right now no please look at the sun when you are under the sun how does it feel how does it feel when you are under the sun the sun is on you is that not but do you notice something I am going to show you something that the way the sun is on you yeah you know it is particular It is very particular and individualized. Is that not true? When the sun is on you, when you are in the sun, the earth only is for you. It is particular and individual. Is that not? Is that not? But do you also realize that? As particular as it is on you, it is also in every way it is. That and we are at the same time. If you stand there now, under that place, it is particular on you. If I stand there, how is this? It is particular on me. God is on everybody. Generally. Yes, particularly on each of them. Because he is the sun. God knows all of us generally. But he also knows us particularly. One by one. Your plans, what he wants you for, your own days, your own fight, everything, everything, intricate, complex, within. Individual like that. Everybody. They are five. Everybody like that. Like that. Like that. Like that. Like that. Like that. Everybody. Particular with each. Look at, I want you to look at the sum of the salt. This, does it not even make you wonder? When this is all said, even the air of your head. Have you ever counted the air in your own head? All I know, how many air in your head have you counted? Have you ever bothered to count? Who have you ever counted? Who have you ever bothered to count? Who have you ever bothered to count the air on his head? Maybe those around you, the air on his head. The live air? Blue. Malay, C-A-S-U-A. You never bothered to pray God? Why have you never bothered to count? Why have you never bothered to count? One for two reasons. There is no reason for counting? Is there no reason for counting? . There's nothing to be worried about. He's lucky, Thierry. I want to count my hair, because so, is that not? Because, so rejection is not something to do, it's not giving something to do. Because, you see it like counting. Is that not true? That's why you have not counted. Apart from the fact that it's not very easy to count. But you know what I'm going to show you? Even those things that I used less to you, it's important to go through. What you will feel is, you know, what is the essence? You won't want to know how many hair you put there. This one has three hundred and fifty-nine billion strands. Look as you get it. Heard that you will cut and will be no more. Now you hear about the price. Look at the price of the field. Today is. Today is no more. Yes, God is particularly. This one. Huh? God is particularly taking this one. God is particularly sweeping the grass. Particularly, until today is here. What about now? If you don't want to hear that tomorrow you know, will you have time for something? Look at this parrot that has time in the air. He said one will not fall except God wants it to fall. Because he said, you know, you want to go to the ground, oh, put the bullet this way. This fellow should not die now. But, you have time. Do you have time for those? Those things. I mean. What are those? Do you? Do you do not think that is a good job to be doing? Because I am showing you the action to which God is involved in creation. If God is busy like this and feeding grass of the fields and making sure that one sparrow don't fall to the ground and all that. So, you think about human beings. God will not have detail plans. I am talking about human beings. Then, we now talk about, eh, those are human beings. Then, what about human beings that you have a deal with them? You have a deal with them. You have a deal with them. Anything. The one that he chose, eh, in Christ, before the world began, there will be no plan. Anything. I am saying you also ought to be a Christian outlook to life. I am not accidental. I am not an interruption. I am not an afterthought. I am God's deliberate thoughts. I am God's deliberate. There is deliberate thoughts. I tell people, I am a child of the brave. I am a product of the tender. Outlook to life. I am not trying to constrain them. And so, if you look at something, look at what he now says. Eh? What follows in verse 19? Eh? What follows in verse 19? Oh, that what? Oh, that you will slay the wicked, oh God. Depart from me, therefore, you bloodthirsty men. For they speak against you wickedly. Your enemies take your name in vain. Do, do I not hate them, oh Lord, who hate you? Do I not love those who rise against you? I hate them with partial hatred. I count them my enemies. Search me, oh God, and know my act. Try me, oh Lord, and know my thought. And see there's any wicked way in me. And lead me in the way of life. What is his response to all this complexity? What is his response to all this complexity? It starts from verse 19. What is it? He says, oh God, that you will slay the wicked. So, who is the wicked? Who is the wicked? The wicked is that man who takes no thought. The wicked is that man, he says, oh God, for somebody to be alive and not see all of this, is a wicked person. For somebody to be alive I'm not here to bother about God. I'm not here to think about God. I'm not here to seek God. Look at all that God did before you came. And you came and you're just living for yourself. And you say, what, what did he did not bother you? You just said, hey, I was born, I was born, and so was, and so was. And you're just living. You say, oh God, oh that you will slay the wicked. Oh that you will kill the wicked people. You say, oh God, you can see that they take your name in vain. Hey, hey, you say, oh God, I didn't bother you for any explanation. Yes, you say, I will, I will do it. No, you say, oh, you will do what you can do, what you do. You say, it's all your fault. You say, you don't take his name in vain. They have no concern about his name. They don't concern about his purpose. They have no concern, they don't concern about anything that concerns God. It doesn't matter to them that God has a purpose. It doesn't matter to them that they are restricted from God's pleasure. They don't hear anything, instead God has checked them with perfect instructions. When I say people who don't bother about you, when I say people who are not concerned with all of these that you have done, you say, God, that's my heart. You can see how I don't associate with them. That's what I say to people who don't believe in you together with unbelievers. It's not just about marriage. It's about the people who don't care about God's name, about God's glory, about God's praise. And you are living and you are going to live. And you are laughing. You are watching pornographs and you are enjoying it. You are watching them and you say, hey, listen to what they are doing. You see, you are laughing at the things. Nobody wants to talk about making him die. I don't mind if you are joking with me. You see, you see, you are laughing. Don't mock at Christianity and you don't feel anything. People take his name in vain. You see all of that. You say, God, fix me. If in any way I have acted like the wicked person, you say, please, God, know me. And you say, please, God, know me. And you say, please, God, know me. And you say, please, God, know me. And you say, please, God, know me. Let me in the path of life. Let me in the path of life. Let me in the path. When you are searching, if you see that in any way I am not true to you. If in any way I am not straight-foot to you. If in any way I am not sincere with you. If in any way I have no...I have no ... By trying toだから priests. No, no, no. Forget your love. If you love me, how to love you. If you are so concerned about me, how to be concerned bit you? If in any way you see anything, if there's anything that is not correct, please know my thought, please put me in the path of life. Don't let me go in the path of death. Don't put me in the path of men that you will slay. And that is why God will slay the wicked. Only that he has reserved it for that to be done. God will very surely slay the wicked. And if you go and take it, go and take it instead for God so love the world. That this will only be God's decision. I believe that this will only be God's decision. You see, you know, for the God of death is turning to the world, not to condemn the world, but that through him the world might be saved. If we believe in him, that he's God's love, he's not condemned. But if we believe not, we reject God's love. He's not convinced of rejecting the love of God, he's condemned already. You see, because he has not believed on the name. Only because he's son of God. That the condemnation is upon the world. God is not even really condemning men for connecations, for lying, for stealing, for adultery. That's not the first condemnation upon the world. What is the condemnation upon the world? That they refuse to accept his love and be converted. Because we know that if they accept his love and they are converted, eh, grace will come so much that will make them live above sin. He knows they can't live above sin. Also in some technology I go and live right. Did you say that? No. He knows they can't live right by themselves. He knows it. So what did he do? He decided to do something to give them ability to live right. And say no, we don't want it. And just as people have said this, they don't take it serious. So what do you want God to do eventually? You cannot stop lying. Okay, I came to give you what to make you live right. Okay, I came to give you what to make you live right. Okay, I came to give you what to make you live right. You cannot stop lying. You did not accept it. The one that accept it, eh, you will not do this. The one said you want him to. That's why the Bible says, eh, if any man refuse this, there is no more sacrifice for sin. But a fearful waiting, a waiting of what? Judgment. For it's a terrible thing to fall into the hand of an angry God. Our God is a consuming fire. That's why he said, oh, that you will slay the wicked. Because it is with, it is, it is gross ardiness. Not to respond to the love of God. When you are looking at someone at night, and you are just reflected on it. I want you to go home. You to see, go back home. And reflect on this thing. And look at this over and over and over again. Go and reflect on it. Are you a wicked person? Go and visually slay the wicked. Are you no wicked? Look at all that he did. Look at all the wicked. Look at all the stupid. Look at everything. He gave me a chance in a million. Go and look at things from the start. Look at things to the finish. And tell me where God has done you evil. That you feel that the best thing to do to you is to ignore him. Let us pray. I want you to talk to the Lord. You know yourself. Talk to the Lord. You know yourself. A reflection on Psalm 139. You know yourself. Talk to the Lord. To the Lord yourself. You know where your life stands. You know how your life stands. I don't know how the reflection came to you but you know yourself. You know yourself. Are you a wicked person? So this is the whole duty of man. The whole duty is to fear God and to keep his commands. That is the whole duty of man. Can you see that man don't have any other duty than to fear God and keep his commands? I am inviting you to pray for her. I am inveting who knows my heart and who knows my feet. Even though you still leave me a part of life. I don't know why I did not pay attention to all of this love that you have shown to me. Lord, help me to reciprocate your love. God so loved us. He so loved us. I am telling you, it's a great love. It's such an intricate love. It's such a complex love. Constantly thinking of you. Constantly thinking about you. Because he has to design something in your life. And he wants the thing to comfort. He has a purpose. He has a purpose over your life. He has something that he wants to bring forth in your life. He has something he wants you to give attention to. He has something he wants you to look at and consider. He did something. And he wants you to see it. He wants you to discover it. He wants you to fellowship with him so much that you can know them. You see, it is the honor of God. It is the glory of God to conceal a matter. It is the honor of the king to search them out. He wants you to search. He wants you to look at what he has proposed for you. What he has put in place for your life. He wants you to be searched out. He wants you to be pursued. Jesus, tell us his love in the book he has given us. Wonderful things. In the Bible I see, this is the dearest that Jesus loves me. Oh! Oh! Oh! I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. He loves me. It is an amazing grace. The in writer said, amazing grace. It is so amazing that you love human this much. That even when we are yet sinners, Christ died for us. It is so amazing, your love, your thoughts about us. The extent that you have done. The things that you have done. The intricacies. The complexity. The profoundness. The upshomeness of these things. Lord, it is so amazing, Lord. It is so amazing, Lord. Lord, I pray this afternoon. Let us wear our hearts. Let us hide it. Let us hide it. Even where our heart is hard. Hard against Him. Even where we are not taking this to heart. Even where we are not realizing the depth, the profoundness of your love. How to say, your love passes knowledge. See the depth of your love, that passes knowledge. Lord, help us to sound the depth of your love. sound the depth of your love a person sound this death this love is so deep it's so deep it's so wide lord that was to sound the death of this love in the name of jesus that lord will be judged that it will die it will die for us then we all are dead so that we enforce we no more live for ourselves who will live for you who died for us and rose again in the name of jesus christ let your love constrain us let your love constrain us let your love constrain us let your love concern us against personal ambitions against personal desires against selfish ambitions let your love constrain us against the moment of self-will let your love constrain us against our desire for sin let your love constrain us oh god in the name of jesus\"}\n"
