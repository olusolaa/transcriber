Don't look down Don't look down If you look down you will go down Don't look down Make up your mind To look ahead Or to look forward And as you look forward My prayer for you is that To the extent to which Your eyes can see You will conquer In the name of Jesus Christ So I thank The exhortation Looking forward Or Looking ahead I will not Look down I will not look down Now We are taking the exhortation From the book From the book of Exodus Actually From the book of Exodus I made reference to this some times ago But I feel Persuaded That we still go there Again We still go there again To look at This episode To look at this episode Particularly as we look Into 2021 And I say Please Look forward Don't look down Don't look down Look forward Exodus chapter 14 The familiar story Of the crossing of the Red Sea The crossing of the Red Sea Say now Say now The Lord spoke to Moses Saying Speak to the children of Israel That they turn And come Before Pihahiriot Between Middor And the sea Opposing Bar Zephon You shall come there Before it By the sea They are to camp Between Middor And the sea That place where they were camping Is opposite Bar Zephon And the Lord said They should camp They should camp there Before the sea Before the sea Before it By the sea Why Is the Lord asking them to camp He said For Pharaoh We said Of the children of Israel They are Bewild By the land And the wilderness Has closed them in Then I will add in Pharaoh's heart So that He will pursue them And I will gain honor Over Pharaoh And over all his army That the Egyptians may know That I am the Lord And they did so Now it was told The king of Egypt That the people Had fled And the act of Pharaoh And the servant was Stunned against the people And they said Why have we done this That we have let Israel Go from serving us So that we may be able to Make ready his chariot And took his people with him Also he took 600 choice chariots I want you to know that 600 choice chariots And all the chariots Of Egypt Are with captains Over every one of them And the Lord Addined the act of Pharaoh King of Egypt And he pursued The children of Egypt And the children of Israel And the children of Israel Went out With boldness So the Egyptians Pursued All the horses And chariots of Pharaoh His horsemen His army Overtook them Camping by the sea Beside Philharioth Before Bar Zephon And when Pharaoh drew near Pharaoh drew near His children of Israel Lifted up their eyes And behold The Egyptians marched Against them So they were very afraid And the children of Israel Cried out to the Lord They said to Moses Because There was no grave in Egypt Have you taken us away To die in the wilderness Why have you so dead with us? Why have you so dead with us? us to bring us up out of Egypt. Is this not the word that we told you in Egypt? Saying, let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians. For it will have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness. And Moses said to the people, do not be afraid. Stand still and see the salvation of your God. When which it will accomplish for you today. For the distance who you see today, you will see again. No more forever. And the Lord will fight for you and you will hold your peace. And the Lord said unto Moses, why do you cry to me? Tell the children of Israel to do what? Go forward. Eh? Do you get it? That's where we got our solution for today. Looking forward. What did he say then? Go forward. Go forward. Ah? Don't look downward. Don't look sideways. Don't look backward. Look forward. Don't look forward. And as you look forward, what should you do? What should you do? Go forward. He said, you know, tell them to go forward. But lift up your rod and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. And I I indeed will add in the acts of the Egyptians and they will follow them. So, I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, his shadows, and his horsemen. The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I have gained honor for myself over Pharaoh, his shadows, and his horsemen. And what happened? The angel of God who went before the camp of Israel moved and went behind them. And the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them. So, it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus, it was a cloud and a darkness to the one and a deep light by night to the other. So that the one did not come near the other all that night. They must have stretched out his hand over the sea. And the Lord called the sea to go back by a strong east wind. All that night and made the sea into dry land and the waters were divided. So, the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground and the waters were a wall to them to their right and to their left and the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea all Pharaoh's horses, his shadows, and his horsemen and it came to pass in the morning wash that the Lord look down upon the hammocks of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud and the Lord troubled the armies of the Egyptians and he took off their shadows away so that they drove with difficulty and the Christians said let us flee from the face of Israel for the Lord fight for them against the Egyptians but the Lord said to Moses stretch out your hand again stretch out your hand over the sea and the water that the water may come back over the Egyptians on their shadows and on their horsemen and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and when the morning appeared the sea returned to a full death while the Egyptians were fleeing into it so the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea then the water returned and covered the shadows the horsemen and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the into the sea after them not so much as one of them remained out of Israel and walk on dry land in the midst of the sea and the water was a war to them to their right hand and to their left hand so the Lord sent Israel that day out of the arms of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashells thus Israel saw the great work which God has done in Egypt so the people feared the Lord and they believed the Lord and his servant Moses praise the Lord this is the meaning I tell you this simple question could anybody or not even could did anybody among everybodygie oh everybody that God delivered could they ever imagine this kind of deliverance did they ever imagine it did you ever imagine it they did not imagine it they did not think that they could ever imagine it they could not imagine it theyNever could imagine that God could have cena It never entered their mind that they will experience such kind of deliverance. It did not occur to them. One thing I want to quickly say is that you know the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter 2, 2 Corinthians chapter 2, it says, What eyes have not seen, nor ears heard, or have ever entered into the heart of men? That is what God will do for them that love Him. I want you to underline the word for this. For them that do what? That love Him. For them that love Him. I want you to know that as we look forward, as we look into 2021, as we round up 2020, I want you to still underscore that word. Against 2021. That there is going to be all manners of deliverance. All manners of deliverance. Deliverance that it will not have occurred to your mind that you will be delivered that way. It will not have occurred to you that deliverance will come like that. It will not have entered your mind. It will not have entered your mind, such deliverance will come. But I want you to underscore it. For them. For them that love Him. For them that love Him. For them that love Him. Now, one thing I want you to see. I will just raise them in the form of points. That is the first thing. will be all manners of deliverance. That's the first thing I wanted to say. All manners, all kinds. But please note my word, for them that love him. So that if you are not loving the Lord, don't raise your expectation. Don't raise your expectation. But if you are loving the Lord, and you are faithful in service to him, please, I'm telling you, expect, be waiting. I want Bangkok, Gujarat. Things you cannot explain. I say unto you, 2021 will be graciously fruitful for them that love God. It will be gracious and we will see the graciousness of God. The graciousness of God. Number two, what I also want you to see is that please, when they were living in Egypt, when they were living in Egypt, positions, where Pharaoh met them, who asked them to come there? Who asked them to come there? God. To come in a place where ordinarily when the enemy will meet with them, eh? They themselves will conclude that there is no way out. Yet it was God who asked them to come there. You know what I'm trying to make you see? Eh? God will be leading us. God will be leading us. What did I say? I say, God will be leading us. will be leading us but please i want you to know that god will be leading us i want you to know that those readings they will not be without challenges what did i say they will not be without challenges it will be leading us it was god who asked them to do us to come in a place where we met them there there was no way of escape for them except by the divine hand of god uh it was not the devil that asked them to come to there that when god begins to lead us don't think that we don't think that there won't be challenges there would be there will be things that will look but let me also announce to you that the purpose of the challenges you know god said it why did god allow them to come to there and the enemy met with them there he said because god wants to gain honor over pharaoh do you get it i want you to know that the reason why those things should be coming is because god wants to be honored in your life god wants to be honored in your life god wants to be honored i want you to notice these things and let them so when they are happening and do we know that the lord told you before You will do as he told you. Eh? When did it begin to happen? Eh? You will not be... Well, I want us, I want you to pray that God, I will not lack understanding. Just pray for yourself one or two minutes that God Almighty, I will not lack understanding. I will be a man, I will be a woman of understanding. I will not lack insight. The insight to look forward. The insight to look ahead. I will not look down. I will not look backward. I will not look down. I will not look backward. I will not lack insight to look ahead and to look forward because I am going forward. I will not lack the insight to look ahead and to look forward because I am going forward. Thank you Father. In Jesus. name we pray. Do you know why I have to pray that prayer? It just occurred within my spirit. When I said, when it is happening, you will know that God have told you. You know that the Lord Jesus told the disciples that what? The son of man will be delivered to the hands of the gentiles. To the rulers. Huh? They would march with him. He will be crucified but on the third day, he will rise again. Do you know that when those things began to happen? Eh? What was what did they say? They said, somebody stole the Lord. Somebody have taken the body of the Lord away. Madeline came to tell them. Jesus' body has been stolen. Peter went there and they believed. Say, oh Madeline, he has been stolen away. Peter himself in terms of looking ahead. Eh? What did he do? He look backward. He went back to fishing. Eh? He did not look ahead in the midst of the challenge. Why? He did not understand that which God was saying. Eh? He could not understand. He could not relate to those things that the Lord said that they have been told before. Why? That we say they were yet to understand scriptures. That's why I'm saying that pray that you will not lack understanding. You may just be hearing me now. Eh? Yeah. Eh? Eh? Okay. And you'll be writing down. But in the midst of your situation, you will lack understanding. I'm not looking backward. I'm not looking sideways. I am looking forward because I am going. What are you saying? What I'm trying to say is that the challenges of 2021, God is saying, men should look forward. Why is God saying, look forward? Why is he saying so? You know, the Israelites, they look backward. Are you aware? Are you aware? Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at what they said. Look at When they saw the soldier, what did they do? They did not look forward again. They told Moses, This is what we have told you. Eh? Allah said to you, Allah is born on you, He did it to you. You don't listen to advice. We have advised you before. Let us have the gift chance. Eh? This year, we are going, we are going, we are going. We are looking forward. We are looking forward. Oh, you are forward now. Where is the way forward? They told him, it would have been better for us to remain the servants of what? Eh? May you not be comfortable with bondage. Out of your bondage, are the challenges that will bring you in your way. Who position wants to silence everything that kept them in bondage? They do things, they begin to look backward. They begin to look backward. Moses, this is what we have told you. And you know sometimes, sometimes, I see people say, you see, I know I have said it. My wife can never change. She can never change. Have you seen people talk like that before? I know. I know. Motimo. Motimo. Eh. Situation is, it will remain. You know how you do it, it decides not to remain. What I am saying is this. Are there things you have been praying about and when God wants to bring you out of it, what will keep you in it will be that he cannot change. Eh. Okay, let's pray. Let's just pray. Let's see what will happen. Eh. You are not ready to see anything. You are not ready to go forward. So you cannot be carried forward. It is the other way. My husband cannot change. Ah. You see, my problem is my certificate. You see, I came out of the top class. Eh. It has become your mentality. And even when God wants to bring something to take you out, you will still be looking backward. Sometimes, God wants to take you out of the situation. All you will be saying is that eh. Eh. There is no money for this thing. Just look. It cannot work. If there was money now, it would have worked. What if God wants to take you out of that situation? That's why I am saying that eh. May you not become comfortable with bondage. Particularly when God is presenting a platform for your deliverance. They looked backward. They said it would have been better. Eh. If we, if we, you know, if we have died in Egypt, than to come and die in this with Daniel. It is not the word that we told you in Egypt. Saying, let us say lo. Let us say lo. Let us say lo. Do you know that what I am trying to say is that certain things will be happening around you in 2021 that you want to say, ah. And this is what I have been saying to you. Eh. I should not have tried this job. I should not have taken this job. I should not have done this thing. I should not have. Maybe I should have then. Maybe I should have. Maybe I should have. But look. Let me tell you. God will be leading. And you follow. I want to announce to you that there will be challenges. Some of those challenges, they will look as if God is not with you. Yet it was God that brought you there. The reason why he brought you there is because you want to be honored in your life. What I am trying to say that at those times look forward. Look forward. Look forward. Look forward. The Israelites, they look backward. Eh. Looking forward. Ah. Because I am telling you, Eh If you love God. you are going forward. That is it! You are going forward. You are going forward. You are going forward. You are going forward spiritually. You are going forward marytally. You are going forward in your career. You are going forward in your business. are going forward financially you are going forward in your health but i'm telling you god is announcing to you today that as you are closing up 2020 and you are moving towards 2021 it is a time to do what look forward look ahead look ahead do you remember something god brought the caring serpent to bite them what did god tell them anybody will look up and would be worth who we say but those who are looking down what will happen to them they will die if not for the mercy of god because later if you read this in ezekiel it's not bible study today i'll have taken you to ezekiel you will see that god said the very day i brought them out of egypt i told them cast away the idols of your art and renounce egypt you know what god said he said but they rebelled against me a phone at the red sea he said but i consider my name so that it will not be blasphemed among the egyptians and so i carried them beyond the red sea what god is trying to say in that prophecy what did he say ordinarily when they looked when they were looking backwards and what would have been the consequence that would have been the end but god said for his name's sake what i'm trying to say is that those who will look down and they will go down but those who will look up and they will go up they will go up unless i want to show you in this place i want to show you this place is the nature the nature the nature of the deliverance do you notice something that's number one uh the egyptians were close to them if there is no divine intervention they will catch up with them is that not but what did god do the pillar of clouds that was in the front of them left them left before it left their front and came away came to the rear when he came to the rear he stood between them egyptians israel this way towards the sea egyptians this way they know what happened again god did not stop there even though it was during the day it was not night but by night and because they could they drove down and normally it is it is pillar of fire that goes by night so see if the pillar of cloud it was today are you understanding me no it is nice will you put it on fire but you know what god did what came in between them it became what darkness so theenter like became what light the bible say so that one could not come before the other i want you to pray that god i will experience your interceptions look at critical moments of life as i move into 2021 that is part of the looking forward oh we are taking the prayer in the midst of the exhortation because we will not be able to finish all of them that god at my critical moment i will experience your intersection the interceptions of god in 2021 no at my critical moment i will experience your interception there will be interceptions of god i'm telling you the things that god will do and for them that love him please don't forget that my word it is for them that love him i will experience you there was an interception there was an interception of god interception of god love as i look into 2021 it will be a year for me of divine moments god it will be a year critical moment your interception i will experience your interception interception i will experience your interception i will experience your interception in the name of jesus five in the name of jesus five in the name of jesus in the name of jesus in the name of jesus lord for my life i pray for my life spiritually in my marriage in my home in my children oh lord my god i will experience your interception in my career in my career in my career lord lord in my life lord in my physical body lord in my in my in my abode in my home upon my father my work in my moment there shall be divine interception 2021 critical moments and critical moments in the name of jesus thank you father in jesus name we pray amen we move on again that exaltation you will notice again that um something further happened so when that up when um god became darkness to one light to the other so they could not come close to one another then god told moses to stretch forth your hand over the sea and of course by an east wind the sea parted the sea parted when the sea parted the bible says it became a what a wall to the right and to the left and when the sea parted it was something beyond the comprehension of the israelites ah it was not something they expected it was something beyond them it was it was the mighty hand of power and i'm telling you the experiences in 2021 will not be too different at different junctions except god stretched forth his mighty hand you cannot get out of your situation ah it will be by the mighty hand of god by the mighty hand of god but what i want you to see further in that place how that when the mighty hand of god appeared that's problem the problem was the sea in the problem not the sea it was the sea what happened The sea became a wall to the right and to the left so that they can walk in it. What I want you to pray, what I want you to know is that those things that will rise up as challenges, as difficulties, as problems, they will become a path, a path for you to walk through. You understand me? It became the wall to the right and to the left. So, do you understand? And I want you to pray. I want you to pray yet again from that. I want you to pray. That Lord, every mountain becomes the stepping stone to greater heights. Every mountain, every mountain. Lord, as I look. Please don't forget our concern that you must look forward. Don't look backwards. Don't look downwards. Look forward. I want you to pray that Lord, as I look forward. Every mountain, whether spiritual, whether financial, whether marital, whatever the mountain will be. Lord, as I go forward, as we round up 2020 and we enter into 2021. Lord. I pray. Every of my mountain, every of my mountain, every of my mountain, there will be the stepping stone to greater heights. There will be the stepping stone, there will be. I want to know what you want me to do. What do you want me to do? Every mountain, every mountain, every mountain, every mountain, every mountain, every challenge, the challenges, the challenges. The challenges of 2021, they become the stepping stone for my increase. The challenges, the challenges, the those things that will come up, oh God, Lord, they will become the stepping stone. The stepping stone. And I want you to pray, not by power, not by power, not by might, but by the Spirit of God. Not by power, not by might, not by power, not by might, but by the Spirit of God. Every, every, every challenge, the challenges, every matter arising, every matter arising shall become my stepping stone. My stepping stone to greater height. Shall become my stepping stone to greater height. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. Thank you, blessed Father. Thank you, blessed Father. Blessed be your name, oh God. In Jesus' name we pray. Let's turn to Habakkuk. I want to make you see. Huh? When I say look forward, how do you look forward? How do you look forward? I want us to look at Habakkuk chapter 2. How do you look forward? Huh? How do you look forward? How do you look forward? Huh? Habakkuk chapter 2. The Bible says in Habakkuk chapter 2, it says, um, the just shall live. By faith. I want us to quickly get there quickly. Habakkuk chapter 2. Habakkuk 2. Look at what the Bible says. In the verse, um, uh, 4. 4b. Huh? But I want to take it from the verse 2. Then the Lord answered me and said, Make it plain on tables. Make it plain on tables. Huh? That he may run who reads it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time. And at the end, it will speak. It will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it. Because it will surely come. It will not tarry. Does that not look contradictory? Huh? Is it not contradictory? Though it tarries, wait for it. It will surely come. It will not tarry. So, is it not contradictory? Huh? Huh? But what is God saying? Did you understand that? Huh? Offering your own eyes. Huh? You remember Lazarus, Mary and Marta. When Jesus came. Huh? For them, Jesus delayed. If you have been here, my brother would not have died. But when Jesus came. Huh? He came on time. Huh? Or after time. Huh? Jesus came on time. But for them, what did theyします? x3 say they said if you had been here if jesus had been there let us still have that huh so because what god wanted is for him to die before he's brought back to life so he said do it may carry that is only fellow jewish it may look as if once god acts once god acts and let me tell you for this israelite that was how it was and for them what would have been better god should have killed pharaoh before pharaoh came yeah that is how it don't look like in 2021 god should have god should have god should have ah but let me tell you god will be there for you on time he will be there for you on time he will be there i'm telling you it's not going to delay he said he will not tally it will not tally if you not tally you do not tally the blessings of god for your life will not tally they will come at their time but he now says and behold the the the proud behold the proud his soul is not upright in him but the just shall live by what by faith so when i say look forward what did god wanted israelites to do huh he wanted them to look forward in what in faith in faith what is the faith that we are talking about hebrews chapter 11 hebrews chapter 11 hebrews chapter 11 what is this faith that we are talking about hebrews chapter 11 ebrune chapter 11. hebrews 11. are you there hebrews 11. uh hebrews 11 what is this fate verse three verse three what must you understand whatever fashion you are carrying i want i want us to read together let's read this as a chorus by faith we are you are not using your own version by faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen are not made from the things which appear do you know what I'm trying to say I want to ask you please can you explain by some physical science by some technology how the water parted and the ground became dry ground the sea bed was dry are you understanding what is the science and the technology please what is the logic what is the theory that can explain that a sea not even a stream a sea while you are looking at the sea the sea began to part the sea parted such that one sea you know the way ice block normally stand it was standing like this as ice block it was standing like this again as ice block and there was a path in that sea and the ground was not wet a better word the sea bed was not wet shall God worry shall God worry at any price let's really talk about data after data has been documented where are we looking at how is the water utan now no tried to start the water is no can share that but that science took place as such a primitive time so if God want to do science now what kind of science will God do? God will surpass you God will shock you God will surprise you God will amaze you God will work for you in strange works if we do in your life it is not yet to find that kind of science see this I want you now science will give you submarine hey I don't know any kind of science I don't know which science we saw was not made from what appeared but we say we must understand by faith that the things that I've seen they were not created from the things that appears eh they were framed by what by the Word of God God them said was the Word of God because we give you advice applies big we praise the Lord respond in the same way I just I like to congregation the We need to understand that, look, our country only, our country only, that one is our country and for jury. Only one, Shibuya, did not see any tractor. They did not see anything, you know, soaking away the water. They did not see anybody carrying a digger or a dryer, drying the water. They did not see anything, but the thing was happening. Why? The thing that we are seeing, that was seen, was not created from what? From what happened. Now we say by faith, we must understand. What I'm telling you is this, that the deliverance God will give you in 2021, it is not based on what you can see. It will be based on what you cannot see. He says so. When we say look forward, we say look forward in what? In faith, understanding that my deliverance will be by the word of God. Even when I stand in a situation. That man will say, this is impossible. I understand that my own word will be created by what? By that which is not seen. It will be created by what? By the word of God. Created by the word of God. Created by the word of God. By the word of God. So when I say we are looking forward in what? In faith. What is the faith? Is that we are looking forward into 2021. On that. Understanding that the things that will be, will not be created by what? By the things that appear. They will be created by the word of God. They will be created by the word of God. They will be created by the word of God. They will be created. And when I'm saying that, I'm not just talking of only spiritual things about your life. What the word of God created in that place was something physical. He divided physical water. Am I correct? Am I correct? Is it not physical water? It was a physical water. It's not something in the spirit. What I'm telling you is that the word of God will create for you the matter of your health, the matter of your job, the matter of your marriage, the matter of your business, the matter of your career. The word of God will work for you in the name of Jesus Christ. It will be created by the word of God which will appear. What must I do? Eh? He said by faith will understand. So you are going to pray for yourself again. Oh God, help me to understand. You see, by faith we understand. You see, it is men of understanding that will break through in this matter. Say, God, help me to understand. I want to be a man of understanding. You say, God, give understanding to the wise. You find that in Daniel chapter two. You see, it is the Lord that gives understanding to the wise. I want you to pray this evening. God, as I look into 2021. As I march towards it. Baba, give me understanding. You probably say it is God that gives understanding to the wise. God gives understanding to the wise. Lord, give me understanding. Lord, give me understanding. Lord, give me understanding. Lord, give me understanding. Lord, give me understanding. Lord, give me understanding. Lord, give me understanding. Lord, give me understanding. Lord, give me understanding. Lord, give me understanding. And you will not experience it. in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus in the name of jesus thank you father looking forward by faith i want to show you something again about this matter of faith when they when when peter and all the other disciples were they were in the in the boats and then jesus was walking on the sea and he was coming when it got near to them what happened he says they were afraid because they thought he was worth he was a ghost i'm showing you what lack of understanding can do it will make you to be afraid it will make you to misrepresent their savior their deliverer was coming lack of understanding they thought he was a ghost what should make them rejoice was making them afraid are you understanding me because they lack understanding and they lack understanding and it was the savior but they were understanding that he was a ghost and because they lack understanding and instead of saying wow the lord is here congrats to the workings of god huh we don't respond correctly to what god is doing around us you might not get the correct result huh but what i want to show you is that why their when their vote and they were still afraid hey you know there is something about peter as one instant they asked they were asked who do you say i am peter said you are christ and jesus said flesh and blood you know rebuild this to you but my father never said so unto you the peopleksi there is something about peter stableman but there was something about him and that's why i tell people look beyond your instabilities look to god god can make something out of your life it was peter i don't know what revealed this one whether it was flesh and blood or it was the father again i don't know because bible did not tell us in this case but in this case again peter said lord if it is you tell me to come the lord said peter come and what happened i'm talking of when i say look forward by faith understand that the world was framed so that the things that we see are not from the things that appear my salary will not come from the things that appear my situation not to not come from the things that appear my my help not come from the things that appear my promotion will not come from the things that appear are you understanding me eh my my my being alive my being healthy eh there is corona there is this there is that there are a lot of things but 21 she will tell me to come and the lord said come and what happened eh peter came out of that boat and began to do what eh he was walking on the stone he was walking on the stone and the very thing that terrified became what a walking stone eh the very thing that terrified the regular was terrifying then that was making them afraid what happened became one you know a walking stone he was just walking on was just walking on it he was walking on the very thing eh that was terrifying them but it was by what it was by what by the word of the lord god there was a word there was a word a word came and the bible says faith commenced by hearing i was hearing the word of god can you pray this evening that i will hear god can you pray this evening that i will hear god because if you don't

taking more uh it's already 6 30 by my time and i've always said we'll try and be rounding up for 6 30 uh what i want to show you again is that if you look at the red sea where we are coming from uh what made god to be honored in the life of the israelites was what was a challenge that was overwhelming pharaoh came very near when pharaoh was far away they were not afraid but when they talk of coronavirus it's like ah it's happening in asia it's happening in london it's happening in u.s you know your mind will be settled nigeria alawa you know your mind will be settled nigeria alawa but once you hear it's happening in lagos it is not in understate there are three cases you know your heart says because it has come near thing comes near when it looks like there's just a narrow margin between life and death and god brought it about it was god that arranged this it was god that arranged this it was god that arranged this look at the second one again pizza that look at the second one again pizza that look at the second one again pizza that i'm showing you i'm showing you i'm showing you eh there was stone where is the master of eh there was stone where is the master of eh there was stone where is the master of the stone the stone the stone where is the controller of the stone was it where is the controller of the stone was it where is the controller of the stone was it not jesus not jesus not jesus yes so when the storm came and it was yes so when the storm came and it was yes so when the storm came and it was coming on the stone coming on the stone coming on the stone eh which means suddenly you could stop the eh which means suddenly you could stop the eh which means suddenly you could stop the stone from disturbing the disciples but he allowed it and he said what's troubling them and they were in the midst of the storm the storm can be in your marriage it can be in the finance it can be in your head it can be it can be in anywhere it can be anything can be finances the storm can be whichever way who allowed it the law but eventually that very storm again become the biggest of what for peter the biggest of what the demonstration of faith he was working on it is that not you know what i'm trying to make you see what i'm trying to make you see uh why there will be why there will be there will be diverse challenges are you understanding me why there will be diverse challenges why there will be diverse issues why there will be diverse things happening i also want you to know this i want you to know this yeah i want you to know this those

happen some will be promoted if you say that you are what you are looking down or you are saying you are seeking to hear god when the storm is there as the storm is coming you are seeking to say baba

the boats one was working on the sea it is telling you that majority will remain in the books majority will be here they'll be in the boats but the men who can hear god who can follow god they will be what they'll be working on this tree so what i'm trying to say is that why there will be challenges why there will be issues why there will be why there will be so many things i want you to know that god did not bring them do you know that people of them have said what would have happened the level will be working on the water may you be among men that will walk on the water let us close for

At the opening of this letter, Paul was trying to explain why he eventually was not able to come to Corinth. He planned to come to meet them in Corinth but somehow he couldn't come. So he was trying to explain the occasion that Leto is being unable to come but in trying to give, in trying to give that explanation, that's a very valiant issue. So Paul was the one who came to Corinth and Paul was the one who was able to come out. And we want to reflect on this issue particularly as it relates to God's image and God's likeness. And when I say in His image and in His likeness what I am trying to say is that may we walk in the image of God and in the likeness of God. of God I want to look at what the Bible reads here about the image of God that we can take a learning for our own life because the matter is be ye only for I the Lord I am what I am holy now let's look at this scripture 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 I take my reading from verse 15 the Bible says I'm reading from you KJV and in this confidence I intend to come to you before that you might have a second benefit to pass by way of you to Macedonia to come again from Macedonia to you and we act by you on my way to Judea therefore when I was planning this did I do it lightly Marcus what did I do it lightly or the things I plan did I plan according to the flesh that I was going through June for the people of Macedonia yeah Venugo was here he said and I saw Jesus coming yes when Jesus came out a lot more I thought oh that's what I was telling you how oh my Christ takes the Nathanite since Noah isget which is Millie you know Jesus would have standing by me it was this one time when Jesus conducts novellas and I understood why God commanded us to did well there was the honest answer but that would be inaccurate yes was not yes and no, but in him was yes. For all the promises of God in him are yes and in him, amen. To the glory of God through us. Now, he who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God. We also are sealed us and given us the spirit in our hearts as a guarantee. Moreover, I call God as a witness against my soul. That to spare you I can no more procure it. Not that we have dominion over your faith, but I'll tell your workers for your joy. For by faith you stand. For by faith you stand. Now, when you look at this scripture that we just read. Apostle Paul was explaining why he eventually was not able to make it occur as he initially planned that it would come. And so, he was giving explanation. And like I said, in giving this explanation, certain matters began to come out. The first thing he said was that, therefore, when I was planning this, I did, did I do it lightly? All the things I planned, did I plan it according to the flesh? That with me there should be yes, yes and no, no? But God is faithful. Our word to you was not yes and no. For the Son of Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, who was preached among you by us, that is, by me, even us and Timothy, was not yes and no. But in him was what? Was what? Yes. Now, what is it that we are trying to learn in this place? What is it that we are trying to see in this scripture? What is it that we are looking at? What is it? Apostle Paul said that, is what today was not what? Yes, yes. No, no. This means, when he told them he was coming, he meant what he was saying. He meant what he was saying. It was something that he meant. In other words, what he was saying is that, I mean, what I say, what I have said, is what I actually intended to do. If you want to put that in a philosophical statement, is meaning what you say, and saying what you mean. Meaning what you say, and saying what you mean. Meaning what you say, and what? Saying what you mean. Paul was saying that, when he said he was coming, he was not saying it as a matter of something he did not mean. He was saying it as a matter of what he meant. And why was it a matter of what he meant? He said because the Jesus Christ which they preached to them was not what? Yes and no. The Jesus Christ which they preached to them is what? Is both yes and yes. That is, Paul is saying that, the promises of God in Christ, the promises of the Gospel that they are preaching, is not something that can be doubted. Is not something that is shaking. Paul is saying that, we brought the Gospel to you, and the Gospel came from the God as light. In you there is no what? Variableness. No what? Shudder of turning. There is no variableness in you, there is no shudder of turning. And so, that is the Gospel. If the Gospel of such a person to them, then we as ministers, our words should not be words. Eh? Yes and no. If we say yes, we mean yes. If we say no, we mean no. Eh? He said to make us see something very important. That actually, in our relationship with people, eh? In our interaction with people, it should be a reflection of what? Of the Gospel that we preach. The Gospel that we preach, is coming from a God, in whom there is no variableness. The promises of Christ in God, they are words. Yea, and they are words. Amen. The ministers who are bringing those Gospels, the believers who are bringing those Gospels, they are allowed to not be words, to not be different. They are allowed to not be different. They are words, eh? To be trusted. They are words, to be dependable. They are words, eh? To be trustworthy. Eh? When they give you their words, they will not need, they don't need to sign a document, for you to be sure, that what they are saying they will do, is what they are going to do. This is a similar thing in the word of our Lord Jesus. When he said, let your yea be yea, and your what? And your nay be nay. Every other thing comes from what? Comes from evil. The first thing I'm trying to show us, in this explanation of Paul, is that it is important, that the way God is constant, the way God is true, the way God is not evasive, the way God is candid, the way God is straight, the way God is transparent, the way God is upright, the way God is forthright. Anybody who perceives this God, can reflect that image. And what? That likeness. If you are preaching, if you are actually, a true preacher of the gospel, if you are somebody who really indeed, bear this gospel, if really indeed, you are somebody who is raised by God, if really indeed, you are having a working relationship with God, if actually, you have a connection with God, and there is a draw between you and God, there is still a cross, between the spirit of God and your spirit. What actually should happen in your life, is that the way God is constant, consistent, faithful, and true, the same thing, we should do what? We should find in your life. So when a man says, I preach God, I know God, I work with God, and we notice that his life, is somebody who is not forthright, is somebody whose word will not depend on it, is somebody who is not candid with his word, is somebody who cannot think for his word, is somebody who is quick when it comes to his word, is somebody whose words are not upright and true, then, that person, is a liar. The truth is not in him. Then, as you can see in the scripture, we actually have worked with God, you notice, we were just making plans to come and visit the brethren. And what did they say? Look at what he said. He said, therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? You know what it means to do something lightly? You are saying it, but what? But what? You don't mean it. You are saying it, but you don't mean it. You are saying it, there is no guarantee that you are going to do it. But you see that man who had worked with God, even when they were living their ordinary day life, when they were planning things with men, when they were planning things with people, they were not doing it out lightly. Why? Because they said, the promises of God in Christ, the gospel that they preach, is not one, yes and no. The gospel is yes. The gospel is straightforward. The gospel is true. The gospel, the gospel, is something that you can rely on, you can believe in, you can rest your life on, and you can be sure it will not fail. So, brethren, as we fellowship this evening, my question to you, the question I am asking you, is that, how dependable, how dependable are your words? Can you be trusted for the things you say? Can men trust your word? When you say something, can men go and sleep? That, no. This brother, this person, this brother, when you speak, this brother, when you talk, no. If it is him who said it, you can be sure it will be that. Oh, who said it? Brother Achilles? Ah! If Brother Achilles is the one who said it, eh? You can be sure he is going to do it. If Brother Achilles is the one who said this thing, then, that is exactly how it is. That is what it means. What I am going to tell you, brethren, is that if as a believer, you lack forthrightness, you lack integrity, you lack sincerity, you lack transparency, eh? Then, you can be sure, eh? You are a liar. You are not working in his image and his words, in his likeness. If we are to be children of God, we should be children who walk in what? Eh? In God's image. In what? In God's likeness. With the image and the likeness of God, the perfect God in us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. When we move on, I want us to see something further again. He said, verse 21, verse 21, the Bible says, Now, He establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us with who? With God. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! See? He establishes us with you in Christ, eh? And anointed us with who? With God. This is a strong word of assurance for us. This is a strong word of assurance. As we live, reflecting His image and His likeness, I want to tell you this truth, eh? Our Christianity, Christianity, is not how much, eh? It's not how much you are laying hold on God. No. But it is the other way round. What is the other way round? How much God lays hold on you. What I'm trying to make you see is that our Christian faith, our Christian faith, eh? Is not, is not, is not so much, eh? There is a place of believing God and working with God. There is a place of diligence. There is a place of holding to God. There is a place of, you know, having faith in God. Yes, that is true. That is very, very true. I don't want you to misunderstand me. I don't want you to misunderstand me, brethren. There is a place of holding to God. There is a place of believing God. There is a place of being diligent with your Christian life. There is a place of being intentional and deliberate with your Christian life. But what I want you to understand that Christianity is not, eh? so much how much we lay hold on God. It is first and foremost how much God lay holds on us. That is the truth. And that is what this scripture is saying. And let me, let me, let me, let me tell you some things in some other scriptures. If you, if you look at Hebrews, Hebrews says, Christ is what? The author of what? Our faith. And what? The finisher of your faith. Who authored our faith? Christ. Who finishes our faith? Christ. The author is the perfect six. I will show you another scripture. Huh? And this one, I want to show you what Jesus said is the will of the Father. Let's look at something in John. Let's go to the book of John. The book of John. John. The book of John. Gospel according to John. Gospel according to John. I want to show you something there that are very, very, very, very important for us to see and note for our lives. When you look at the Gospel according to John, chapter 6, look at what the Lord said in that place. It was speaking in all opposites of God. It was speaking in all opposites of God. It was speaking in all opposites of God. I want to show you the final epistle of the John chapter 6. Before we read that from John chapter 6, let's read in that of John chapter 15 verse 16. We will now come to John chapter 6. John For a servant does not know what his master is doing. But I called you friends. For all things that I have heard from my father, I have made known to you. I called you friends. So, to move on to the bassist thing. You did not do what? You did not do what? You did not choose me. But I chose you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brethren, are you getting something? Are you getting something? Yes. We believe in God. We come to God. Whichever believes shall be saved. Whichever believes shall be saved. Huh? That is the truth. But I am showing you a very a very fundamental truth. About the their issue. The very fundamental truth is what? Is what? We did not two truth but what it shows us it shows us now let me relate it to john chapter six john chapter six john chapter six i want us to see it from from the verse um i want to take it from okay let me take it from where we're talking about that in the bread of life okay from verse 35 jesus said to them jesus said to them i am the bread of life who comes to me i never want you shall never hunger and he who believes in me shall never work first but i tell you that you have seen me and yet you do not believe all that the father gives me will come to me and the one who comes to me i will watch i will not i will know why cast out so i have come from heaven let me read it for this this reading so i have come from heaven not to do my own belief but what but the will of him who sent me and please what is the will of him we sent in can we share different translation i want us to use the mic let us do this translation what is he willing of the father what is the will of the father let's try to find that out translation look in there he says this is the will of the father who sent me that of all he has given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up on the last day please some other translation some other translation some other translation John 5.9 look in there he says this is the will of the father who sent me this is the will of the father who sent me that of all he has given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up at the last day translation is that some other translation translation please thank you that all of all which he has given me of all he has given me i should lose nothing i should lose nothing but she should she should raise it up at the last day but she raised it up at the last day is anybody having any energy amplified amplified this is the will of him who sent me the will of thing who thanks me that of all that he has given me that of all that he has given me i lose nothing i do not i lose nothing i should lose nothing but i give new life and raise it top at the last day but i do what i give new life and raise it up on the last day i give books new life and do not again and raise it do not again I DO NOT GIVE LIFE I 것을 I should do nothing but i should lose nothing but I give new life and raise it up at the last day but i did what i give new life i raise it up on the last day I GOT Sticky thought I should give you books new life until you are together i raise all the he but I do you give new life and raise it up on the one thing we talked about my Light F 새it and raise it up where? On the last day. NLT. And this is the will of God. This is the will of God. That I should not lose even one of all those he has given me. I should not lose even one of all those he has given me. But I should raise them up the last day. Please, what is the will of God? Are you seeing the will of God? What is the will of God? The will of God is that Jesus should not lose everybody that God gave him. There is a purpose of God. There is a mind of God. There is a will of God. Eh? The will of God is that Jesus should not lose anyone. If you ask me, what is God's will? What is God's will for my life? What is God's will for my life? That Jesus should not lose me, but he should raise me up the last day. What is God's will for your life? Jesus should not lose you, but he should raise you up on the last day. What I'm trying to make you understand that there is a will of God. Eh? There is, there is, it is not how much the matter is yet. We are holding to God. But the matter is, eh? The real matter is that God is in what? God is in what? God is laying on him on us. And that is why what we are reading in that 2 Corinthians chapter 1 is very, very vital to our work with God. It is very, very vital to our work with God. That, that verse 21 of chapter 1 2 Corinthians. It says, Now, he who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us his will is God. You know what that means? The person who establishes us his will is God. His God. Now, how is God eh? doing this establishing? Well then, I want you to see something very, very, very vital. Very, very vital for our work with God. And very, very vital for how we relate with people. Because don't forget our theme for the year is be ye holy for I the Lord am holy. And I said everything we'll be doing this year is a call for us to be like our father who is in heaven. God want us to be like him. And I want to show you something here about God. Now, the Bible says, he who establishes us, he who establishes us his will is God. Look at how God is doing this. Verse 22. How is God doing this? Verse 22. He says, He will also have filled us and given us the spirit in our hearts as the worst. My version says as a guarantee. Is there any version with a different word? My version says as a guarantee. Look in this as a guarantee. Any other word? From our cross translations, NLC verse 22. He has identified us as his own. By doing what? Okay, the only speech in our hearts as the short installment that guarantees everything he has promised us. Hallelujah. Please, what we need is that it is God who is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. He is God. This is very special to your work with God. It is God who is establishing us. What is the matter that it is God who is establishing us? Because of the way God is processing our salvation or processed our salvation anyhow you want to put it. Huh? Processed because we are already saved. Processing because we are still saved in hope. Huh? That when Jesus comes, we will be exactly like him. We have this hope in us. Now look at what the Bible says. It says, If we also have saved us, what is a sin? What is a sin? What is a sin? What is the purpose of a sin? Huh? What is the purpose of a sin? Is it about a final decision? What is a sin? A sin is a sign of genuineness. When you feel something, huh? You are stamping that this thing is genuine. You feel you authenticate it. You secure it. You see it. The Bible says he has saved us. Do you know what God did? Do you know what God did? Huh? In establishing us. Number one. Huh? There is authentication. We have been authenticated. We have been secured. How did he do that? How did he do that? The Bible says he gave his spirit. He gave his spirit as a guarantee. In fact, he stole it. Please, what is a guarantee? If you go to the market to buy something, huh? And you tell the person that this thing, you want to, I want to come back to pick it. What will the person tell you to do? What will the person tell you to do? The person will say, ah, it's not guaranteed though. If you want it to be guaranteed that I don't sell it, huh? What will he ask you to do? For it or give a damn? When you ask how much is it? And he says, 5,000 Naira. It's OK madam. Take this 3,000. Huh? I'm coming back to pick the 3. Is that thing guaranteed? Is it guaranteed? It's guaranteed. Now, the Bible says that God gave us his spirit in our hands. What we don't know is we don't know. spirit in our heart as a guarantee you know what god did why god is the one establishing us what did he do god bought us jesus is coming back for us is that not so god i think that jesus will come back for you what is going on god a guarantee a threat installment what is that installment that installment is his spirit what i'm trying to make you understand is that when god wanted to guarantee that look be at rest i am coming back for you god did not give anything less than himself god gave what his spirit god gave the holy spirit please who is the holy spirit who is the holy spirit is your spirit less than god is very fruitless than god so god gave not a tax payment to guarantee that i am coming for the king what did he do he made the world a full planet gave himself that look i am coming back for you what i'm trying to make you see is that because god has invested god god puts into us his best that is why god is making sure that what that's not on the last day we are what we are raised up do you know that if you have gone to the market and they say something is five thousand and you have paid four thousand naira already just to balance one thousand to collect it are you likely to go back to pick that product are you likely to go back or not go back are you likely to go back you are likely to go back that is what god did and now please you are perfect four thousand on a product of five thousand what is in your heart i want to explain something about this matter ordinary you want to do your heart if there is a product that you want to teach from the buyer and you have paid you have made an instrumental payment on that team to come back to balance the product you had to pay for the product anyway because you know that if god has invested he will not take money in yourDon't allow me to collector the funds unless you just before you know the detail he was given you that it was just a game of keeping so if you decide you wanted to invest til the right time and don't need the money for the next thing it here you take that amount come on obviously if that's not the case you have to pay for the product fire a save your life reason why God is the one establishing you is because God has made a down payment once you pay four thousand once you hear that something is happening in that market fire is burning talk to your heart hey something that i paid for you quickly carry your phone madam madam my product you begin to have genuine interest in your product what i'm trying to is your product because you have made advance payment what i'm trying to make you see is that look God has a genuine interest over your life if you don't know i am you today God has a genuine interest over your life God has a genuine concern over your life God has a sincere concern over your life God has a real concern over your life because over your life God has made a down payment there is a down payment and let me tell you that is why Jesus said i am coming back the will of the father is that of all that he has given me i should not lose any of them but i should raise them up on the last day i want to tell you not guaranteed that Jesus will come for me on the last day it's not so much about me it's so much about Jesus what really guaranteed i'm telling you about an assurance in your heart your assurance in your heart in your heart is that the interest of God over my life is genuine it's really it's not fake it's something that God has made a down payment over and there is a will of God that i should not be lost Jesus want to raise me there is a genuine interest of God over my life and so i am sure that look there is this hope that Jesus will come for me what i'm trying to make you see brethren right if this hope is not alive in you you will be living anyhow one reason why people live anyhow is that they are hopeless you see when you are hopeful the reason why many of us are not faithful to God is because we are not hopeful in God and what i'm trying to make you understand if you if you if you can get up from this meeting we proclaim on that candling in your heart that God has a genuine interest over my life God has a sincere interest over my life God has respect over my life that that客 of God over my life is nothing less than God it is the spirit of God that he gave me God has this fake in me God have this interest in me this is a guarantee that definitely when Jesus comes I will go with him when God helps you you will not live anyhow the Bible says when Jesus comes you will stay with him and when you ask him for help you not will live anyhow the Bible says this that is the guarantee when Jesus comes you will go with him when you ask him for help you will not live anyhow bible says those who have this hope in themselves one look at that in john chapter chapter 3 verse 3 look at what the bible says first john chapter 3 verse 3 first john chapter 3 verse 3 i want to make you see why many people cannot live pure today it's because their hope is not in the coming of jesus their hope is in this life and the bible says to set on the earth on our message if in this world only you have hope then of all men you are miserable you will be miserable but you see men who have this understanding that the real thing about my life is that god has a genuine interest over my life god has a genuine interest a sincere interest and god is doing everything so that i can be raised on the last page that is why the bible says who establishes us is god the person making sure i don't fail is god the person making sure i don't fall is god the person make you try going back side is god the person making sure your sin is god the person making preached love is god is god and if that person is god i can be i can be this sure i will make it go to heaven it is not so much about me it is so much about him let this earth be alive in you let Let this earth be strong in you. Let this earth be real in you. Let this earth be real in you. Let this earth be there. That is what you need so that you can reflect its image. You can reflect its likeness. You can say, God, you have a sincere interest in me. God, you have a genuine interest in me. God, you have showed me by making a down payment. You have guaranteed that your interest in me is genuine. And that you are coming back for me. God, I will live for you. God, I will wait for you. God, you are my portion. You are my last man. Therefore, I will trust in you. That is what makes me to live a holy life. That is what makes me to live a correct life. Huh? It is where you are hopeful that you will be faithful. If your hope is not filled in God, your strength will not be filled in Him. If you are hopeless, you will be faithless. Huh? If you are hopeless, you will be faithless. If you are hopeless, you will be faithless. And I am showing you how to reflect its image. Reflecting its image. I want to show you just something in John. 1 John chapter 3. Let's see that scripture. John chapter 3. The Bible is a matter of hope and purity. The matter of hope and purity. The Bible says, look at how the Bible begins it. And I pray you really understand it. The Lord said to John chapter 3 from verse 1. What manner of love the Father has bestowed on us. Oh brethren, do you know great love? Do you know great love? Huh? Somebody wants to guarantee ordinary, ordinary. Do you know what the Bible says? Do you know what the Bible calls us? Huh? Huh? He said, what is man? Huh? That you visit him. What is man? What is man? That you are mindful of him. Huh? I want to make you think. You know, I was talking to somebody one day. I said, the gap between God and man. Huh? It's more than the gap between man and animal. Huh? And yet. Huh? Nobody can say, animal is my son. And adopt animal to come and bear his slave. You see, we don't understand this love of God. This love of God for man. This love of God. You see, if you understand this love. Do you know what Apostle Paul said? Huh? He said, the love of God constrains us. That we just judge. That if one dies for all, then all are dead. That we will live. We no more live unto ourself. But unto him who did what? Who died for us. And us again. If you understand the love of God, you will not live anyhow. If you understand how much God loves you. And that is why. You know. I always say. The fear of God. Is the beginning of wisdom. But the love of God is the perfection of wisdom. When the love of God begins to constrain you. When you are constrained by his love. That you cannot live anyhow. I can't live for anything but for this God. He loves me this much. How can somebody want to redeem or marry me. And he wants. To give me a guarantee. Can God lie? God cannot lie. But to tell you that least. I'm not only saying that you don't trust in me. I'm going to make myself trustworthy. To make himself trustworthy. So you can be sure. This one that God says he will come. Maybe he may not come home. God cannot lie. But God still want to show you that. I'm not only saying it. I'm going to do something. God not get the down payment again. He gave his spirit. See. I'm giving you my spirit. To tell you that I'm coming back. He did not only say it. He went ahead to show practical things. That he can be trusted. If he had just said it. Without a down payment. He would come back. But he went ahead. To demonstrate to us. That look. I am coming back. So he guarantee me that he's coming back. He made a down payment. Then you know what many of us love? The Father. Has the power in us. That we should become children of God. Therefore, the world does not know us. Because it is not knowing. They don't know us. You know what the Bible is saying? When they say come and tell lies. I say sorry I cannot lie. Oh how I love Jesus. This boy is mad. They don't know us. They don't understand what is your problem. Why can't we just take bread like others? Why can't we just see like others? Why can't we just compromise like others? Why can't we feed God's next morning like others? Why can't we be moral like others? Why can't we be wealthy like others? Why can't we be wealthy? What is the problem of this man? What is his problem? Do you know why they are wondering what is their problem? Because they don't know him. They don't understand that we know his law. And that is why we are living for him. And when you say, oh, I can't do it. I am a child of God. They will be wondering. Take a look at Nigeria. Take a look at Nigeria. Is that what we help in this situation? Is that what we give you? Is that what we place bread on your table? Is that what we give you Job? You can't change your age. Tell lies about your state. Do something to survive in this nation. And he says, sorry. That is against my Jesus. And then they will be wondering. Because they don't know us. They don't know. And that is why when you see them living anyhow. And they think like disciples of Jesus. They don't know him. They don't know his law. If we didn't know his law. His law will persuade you to live for him. Your words will not know us. Your words will not know us. Your words will not know us. We want to be wondering about our lives. What kind of man is this? What kind of just compromises with us? What kind of student is he? What kind of just sits along with us? What kind of police officer is he? What kind of just go along with us? What kind of lecturer is he? What kind of just go along with us? What kind of doctor is he? Why can't you just go along with us? Why can't you just go along with us? The world does not know us because they don't understand that we we have come to understand the love of God we have come to know that look that is a God who has a genuine interest over our life and he has made a down payment that look this world are going to wipe it away but i'm making a new one and i'm going coming back to come and take you there i'm going to prepare a place for you take heed of my spirit i'll give you my spirit and i'm guaranteed to do it if i'm coming back i cannot see that and know that and begin to live anyhow i will wait for that god that is why i said one of the people of that generation is lack of vision the bible says the other is not vision the people perish the vision of reality people son of God, the vision of all God is not, it is not you and you see what a vision except for a nell and you see the vision of God is doing the vision of how God is coming the distance of what is to come they cannot see what can they see they can only see now i pray for you may you see beyond the now may you not be a man of now men of men of now they don't go far do you remember this or if i was a man of now he said what is that right to me what is that right to me and what is that right i am dying now i want to eat food now i must forget this that's right give me this you take it away he was the man of now men of now they don't last men will live for now and for now they don't last when we live for now for now they they have no future they wish all their all their concerns your preoccupation is now man you can see the future there are men who also have no future now who can see the future there are also men who have no future and that is why vision is a very important thing the greatest property in the life of a man is not money but vision the greatest province in the life of any man it's not property but vision it's not money it's vision and when i say vision i don't just mean i don't mean physical thing i mean ability to see to dream ability to sing to god to see what god is doing to hear what god is saying he said the other body has not lost because he does not know him look at what the bible now say verse 2 below hallelujah he said now we are children of god and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be but we know that when he revealed we shall be like him for we shall see him and you see men who are looking towards his image and his likeness men who want to reflect his image and his likeness in his image in his likeness he says he says beloved now we are children of god now not later now we are living as children of god holiness is now purity is now that's what that is now is now sincerity is now and that is why i said the last time so when your lights don't shine enough for men to see that something is wrong with your life it's not just that i am born again i'm a child of god they did not put a sticker on your chest believe it or not i'm a child of god who is who is arguing with you what is the controversy if you have to say believe it or not i'm a child of god you don't even need a speaker when men see let your life so shine that men may see not not that god we see we say my identity is inside my heart you don't understand what we are talking about my whole life is inside my heart you don't understand what we are talking about god knows that i am sincere so we are talking beyond that it is one thing to be holy it's one thing to be seen as being holy it is one thing to be pure it is one thing to be seen as being pure and jesus wanted to see and jesus flooded us to do so it is a not your life on side but lord we do us we see and when you see what will happen when you give glory to your father if the light don't shine for men to see what is the essence of the light that don't bring glory to god that's the question i answer you you said you are a child of god because that is in your heart only let us in your heart faith is in your heart what the take it to your heart men cannot see you don't even come to God what is the essence what is the essence for you will not be foolish i pray that your eyes of understanding will be opened in the name of Jesus may your life not lack wisdom because men who talk like this they are foolish no wise what is the essence of a light that does not bring glory to God you say you have light i'm a child of God i'm a child of God but glory don't come to God that you are a child of God it is better that you have no one the one that the master wants is the one that men can see the one that men cannot see it's not the one that we want you can be loved now not later now we are children of God and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be but we know that when he say be we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is there is this hope to be like him we are living like him because we are hoping that when he appear we become exactly like him we are living we are living in his image now in his likeness now of that thing look at what he says look at what he says look at what he says pathway the connection between hope and purity that's why i said when you are not hopeful in god you can never be faithful to god when we notice you are not faithful to god because your hope is not in god if you notice that you are not godly you are not upright you are not living according to god sincerity frankness integrity goodness cannot be seen in your life you are crook you are perverse you are a deceiver you are a liar you are not holy you are not pure you cannot be trusted for the world you cannot be taken for your statement you are corrupt you are bad you are full of here to follow bible well you noted that you are not faithful to god i declare to you because your hope is not in god look at the connection everyone that has this hope in him purify himself just ask is pure can we see that in nlt as we close this in nlt niv Amplified John 1st John 3 Which is in our translation As we close this evening It's already almost 6.30 To be rounding up now In his image And in his likeness In his image And in his likeness 1st John 3 NLT NLT And All who have this eager expectation All who have this eager expectation We keep themselves pure We do what? Keep themselves pure We keep themselves pure Just as he is pure Just as he is pure You've seen that? When you see men who are not living pure What is their problem? What is their problem? Eh? Their hope is not in him Eh? They are not reflecting his image And his likeness We pray hope that when he comes There will be a consummation Of that work Everybody who has this hope in himself Purifies himself Just as he is pure Then as we close today I want to plead with us Are you walking in his image?
