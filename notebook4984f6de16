Or I am holy Third Peter, chapter 1, verse 1 It says, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ To the pilgrims of the passion In Pontus, Galatia Cappadocia And Bithynia Ilet, according to the foreknowledge of God Ilet, according to the foreknowledge of God Ilet, according to the foreknowledge of God The Father He The sanctification of the Spirit Obedience And sprinkling Of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace to you And peace Remultiplied Blessed be the God And Father of our Lord Jesus Christ Who according to his abundant mercies Has begotten us Again To be To a lively hope Through the resurrection of our Lord Jesus from the dead So you notice that Peter categorically made it clear That what God brought us into is what? A lively hope Those who have hope Don't forget what we mentioned last week There are just fundamentally two categories of people in this life Why all the other people have hope? Why all the other people have hope? Why all the other people have hope? Why all the other people have hope? Black lines are there to divide them. Rich, poor, male, female, young, old, this, that, that, that. Fundamentally, there are people who were brought into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And there are those who are outside that hope. And the matter that we are addressing in this place is that Peter is speaking to those who were brought into this hope. If you look at it, he said, Peter, Peter, an apostle of Jesus, to whom? To the pilgrims. So the matter here, is to whom? To these pilgrims. He said these pilgrims, they are elects according to the foreknowledge of God. God chose them through the sanctification of the Spirit. And then he made it clear that these people should bless God, these pilgrims, these elects, they should bless God. Who according to His abundant mercy, has begotten us again to a living hope. So there was humanity entered into what? Hopelessness. Whatever thing you want to describe human beings are. Whether rich, whether poor, educated, illiterate, young, old, they became hopeless. They became people that were without God, and they were without hope. So, but by the election of God, by the foreknowledge of God, by the workings of the mercy of God, what God did was to separate us from hopelessness into what? Into a life of hope. So, no matter what I was going to tell you categorically as we start this journey, of be here only if I am holy, with that peace, you need to know, no matter how you divide it, I am still an undergraduate, I don't have so much money in my pocket, this is what is going on, that is what it is, I want you to first know that categorically, eh? By the reason of your coming into Jesus, you are not a no place person. You are not a hopeless person at all. You are not. Eh? You are not hopeless. It don't really matter what could be happening around your life. The first thing to make yourself understand, that fundamentally, I am not a hopeless person. You see, this becomes very, very, very, very important, particularly as we move into our nation Nigeria. When you look into how dark things are, when you look into the political scenario of Nigeria, the economic scenario of Nigeria, the educational scenario of Nigeria, when you look, when you look into governance, when you look at the level of insecurity, when you look into the way human lives are being raised on a daily basis, and there is no governmental response, eh? For security, for protection, when you look at the way, the way, um, um, um, security are taking a dimension that makes everybody not to be able to sleep in a way, eh? When you look at Nigeria, when you look at the exchange rate, that we are talking about 73 Naira, eh? To just one dollar, when you look at the way things are expensive, when you look at, nobody said, will I ever be able to build a house again, if a bag of cement is now 4,800? I'm not short for this, ah! Eh! You know, but you know what I told the person? I just spoke in a Yoruba adage. I said, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I told him that the one small old man asked him, , , . , , . . . . . . . . . . And I said, bro, what you need to realize is this. He said, see unto the righteous, it shall be well with you. I said, bro, be careful. Life and death, they are in the power of the tongue. Huh? You make yourself a hopeless person. What am I saying this evening? Is that peace? If you have a clear understanding that you are born again, you know that you have come into Jesus, and that you are knowing Jesus, you are having a walk with Jesus, you can confidently tell yourself that I'm not a hopeless person. I'm not hopeless. My situation is not hopeless. You know why? So that scripture, look at Psalm 46. So we'll be taking the journey gradually. The year only. I am only. Look at what the Bible says in Psalm 46. Psalm 46. Psalm 46. Are you there? Psalm 46. Psalm 46. I will read verse 1 and 2 in three different translations. Just to bring the message. Just to bring the message. He says, Even if the earth is removed, and though the mountains descend to the midst of the sea, though it's not as you are in trouble, though the mountains shake, but it's swelling, what should we say? The Lord is our what? He's our strength. He's our what? And our strength. The what? The very present life. No. Is there trouble in Nigeria? Is there trouble? Is there trouble? What should be our confession? Our God is our what? He's our refuge. He's our what? Our strength. A very present, not just present, a very present help in trouble. When, now that there is trouble, I want to announce to you, God is present. Are you understanding me? God is present. God is present. God is present. Don't you know that God is present before? God is present now. We are not hopeless. We are not hopeless people. Don't you carry the mentality of hopelessness. Don't you carry the, the, the, the, of hopelessness. Don't. We have begotten us into a what? A living hope. Our hope is alive. My hope is not dead. It doesn't matter what is happening around. My hope is not dead. I have a living hope. I am going somewhere and I am getting there by the hand of the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ. You are coming somewhere brother or sister and you are getting there. We are not oppressed people. Even if the earth is removed. Even if the universe is destroyed. Even if the universe is destroyed. Even if they remove the whole of Nigeria today. Even if the government scapships. Everything entered. Everything. Everything. Like in Yoruba as we say, Don't Kwhere. Don't do this. I am not hopeless. What can I say? You are not hopeless. Please you are not hopeless. Please tell yourself, I am not hopeless. I am not. Like in the g messaging of our lives. I'm not hopeless. Huh! Ohhh! Now the first thing I'm calling your attention to, we were begotting into a what? A lively, a living hope, eh? Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. I would, I would emphasize that a little more as we go on. But note, we have, he has brought us into a living hope. We are in 1 Peter chapter 1. We are now in the verse 3. People are just coming in. Well, because of the lively hope, now, coming into that hope through the resurrection, the resurrection of our, of Jesus Christ, our Lord, that resurrection from the dead brought us into a hope. Now, Now look at this next thing he said. Huh? Begotting us into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Not only that. What's the next thing? Eh? What's the next thing? Verse 4. What have you been, what have you been brought into again? Verse 4. Eh? And in every times, not incorruptible. Number 1. You have been given a living hope. Number 2. You have been, say what again? You have been given a living hope. When in every times, incorruptible. Do you understand? Okay? You see one thing you must tell yourself. One thing you must wake up into. Alright? Is that your inheritance can never be corrupted. That is why I do struggle in every times with people. That is not my inheritance. My inheritance can not be corrupted. This are things you must tell yourself about. This are things you know. And that is why we know when the man was telling Jesus Christ, Tell my brother to divide the property which is that my father gave to us, so that he does not take everything. He said take it and beware of covetousness. Who make me a judge over you? For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of haughty processes. Your life is not in your possession. These are things we must understand as believers. It's an unfortunate thing that we are experiencing today in the church. We have been made so attached to material and physical things that they ruin our emotions. They bring unnecessary emotions, unnecessary anxieties out of us. They don't make us to see that our actual inheritance in Christ is not something material or physical. It's an inheritance that has been prepared for you that cannot be corrupted. Eh? Something that cannot spoil. It cannot be corrupted. Eh? I have been brought into that. Eh? So, if I have been brought into that, then as you hold the things of this place lightly, much more the more brethren, because the coming of the Lord draws near. Much more the more. Eh? Let us hold the things of this life lightly, practicing scriptures. Eh? You see, when we begin to see that things are drawing nearer and nearer. You see, let those who are married. Eh? You know, who live with an understanding as if they are not married. Let those who are using this world without corrupting it. Let those who are giving instruction. The point of that thing is that let us hold this earth lightly. Because actually, if you can see correctly, you will understand that men who are sane. Mark the word that I use. Sane. Sanity. Men who are sane. Eh? Don't fight. Eh? Over what has been thrown into those things. Am I correct? Am I correct? The earth is reserved for fire. If there's a treasure on earth, eh? Then who reserved it for fire? The earth has been subject to vanity as far as eternity is concerned. So all the elements in it is going to melt with fire. God has reserved it for fire. What you reserve for fire is what is no more useful. Something has been reserved by your father for fire. And then you are making that thing to make you to leave your father. And you remember that thing? If you can see properly, you will know that work is here. Eh? You're so transistory and so ephemeral. And we were just talking yesterday. Was it me and Victor? I can't remember who we were talking. We were discussing a medical doctor that died. And he was telling me that, oh, after the death of that man, did I know what happened? The lady asked me too. I said, what happened? He said, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. The patient could not be sustained again. The, the opt cùng Merena has been converted to residential building. Now when that man, Victor subject Leeford, he fell down and died. He's a medical doctor. Now I can't remember what he has packed and packed and packed and packed and packed in that place. I would have said to him soon, now you have a good job. I am a doctor, you will be able to take care of myself, I will live long. I don't know you understand it. And all those things that somebody has been doing. Was that right? Yeah. Somebody have labor to build. Somebody has just came and said, what's all this thing? They are useless. Turn this thing to residential building. That is the nature of the very town that is here. When you see family members, you know, red one, they buried the father. They are making arrangement to bury the father. During the burial ceremony, one of the siblings arranged military men to come and scatter the party and beat up all the siblings. Because they are here to decide that it was the property that they are all striving for. And they have not settled it. So for him, various things should not take place yet until they have settled that property too. The others went ahead to build an evisional building. The others went ahead to build an evisional building. So he arranged thugs, policemen and military officers. They came, of course, beat everybody in the party, scattered the whole party over. I just told myself, the person who owns the thing that is dead now, eh, I've left it. It is those who are trying to come into it. Where in my mind of them will be alive in three days time? I'm just trying to make you understand. I'm trying to make a point. We are going to a very vital issue. Be ye holy, for I am holy. And what you noted the way this passage started, this is trying to make us realize who we are and what we have. But when it comes to the matter of holiness, you will see that the things that are dragging you away from God, they don't worth it. They don't mean who you are. The things that are dragging you back in Jesus is not making you, eh, to live only. They don't worth it. You don't sense of it. You don't. You don't know how you will live then. You don't know where you will live then from. You don't know where you will live then. You don't know where you will live then. Even as you are possessing them, eh, they are corruptible. Every material increase, eh, always bring one additional care. I mean one additional burden. And if you are not careful, material increase will bring one spiritual decrease. Go and check. I will just give one very simple example for you. If you don't have phone, the day you get phone, the number of times you spend meditating will reduce. If you are not careful. I am saying if you are not careful. If you have not bought a car, you don't worry about mechanics. Once you buy one, your prayer point increases. Lord, please make me mechanic. Because you have vanity. Getting them don't really bring you into a duress that you are looking for. They only create small burden. That's why they say big man, big trouble. Small man, small trouble. Even the ordinary people in life, they know that big man have big trouble. Have you ever seen a man who just don't, who have not been able to put a door in his house, looking for security man to guide the house? Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. I don't understand him. The man built his house and he has not been able to put door. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. I don't understand him. He just cross the road like this and go out. You don't see him looking for security man to guide the house. Why? He that is down needs fear no fall. Like the Superboy song by John Boone. Travel double pilgrim progress. He that is down needs fear no fall. If you are down, there is nothing to fear that you won't fall. I call you down the ground and you do like this. But as you begin to climb up, as you begin to, hey, hey, don't move you stay there. So, as you begin to, he that is down needs fear no fall. He that is low, no pride. You see, I probably need to understand that acquiring them, eh, does not mean you have a better life. That is it. To people think the more you have it, the better life you have. But it's not true. It's not really true. Eh? Simplicity is wisdom. Now, the point I'm trying to make is about this inheritance that you are, that is prepared for you. You are brought into a lively hope. You are brought to an inheritance incorruptible. You are brought to an inheritance, you know, undefiled. To an inheritance that does not fade away. Eh? Reserved for you. Eh? In heaven. In your Father's kingdom, for you, for your children, for you. Eh? To when we are behaving as if we don't care about this, we are because there is resolve and we are understanding it. Eh? We do not know if it has been resolved. We are looking to want the one that is reserved for us. Eh? No. This one should not make us use that one. Because if we even get this one, you cannot hold it for long. But once I enter into that one, it's for life. A man was able to acquire a car, and driving the car, eh, he miscalculated learning to drive, wanted to apply brake, he applied accelerator, and as he put things wrong, unfortunately, eh, became a major accident and he died. That is the nature of inheritance that is here. Eh, they are vain. If that man didn't buy a car, maybe he would have lived a little longer. And you understand the nature of inheritance. Eh, do you know still that as you are now, eh, if I give you five hundred thousand, I give you like this cash, you will not be normal again as you are going on. Everybody around you will be like a sword. Eh! This person wants to kidnap you. Eh! You will be looking like everybody that comes around you, you will carry that pocket to this side. Am I correct? Eh! Acquisition brings anxiety. I am trying to make you understand something. I remember my pastor friend. He was giving the gift of a car. He was the one telling us. People were like, wow, this thing sells. It is just a big man, big trouble. I said, what is it? He said, do I know that? Because the church is somehow inside, but it is in an upstairs. You can see where the car is parked. Eh! He said, so why do you park the car? Because it is brand new. Eh! He said, you see now, we stay in the office. After we get up again, we go and check. What I cannot do is tell you. He said, you took in about two dollars to be balanced in the office. Nothing will happen to the car downstairs. Eh! You just go and check again. Huh? He said, you took in about two dollars to be balanced in the office. Nothing will happen to the car downstairs. Eh! You can go and check again. Huh? You know, I need to understand the nature of enmity. What as if these things are wrong? There is something wrong. Please get me right. We are after the church. We are after the church. We are after heaven. We are after God. We are after we. We are after everything. We are, I'm trying to understand that they must not be because of their nature. Eh? It is, it is, it is foolishness to extinguish them from other kind of inheritance. That's what we are saying. As long as it's not inestimable, people can get a car. Eh? On the ground of uprightness and loneliness. Of course, help them and we get one. I'm not understanding what I'm trying to say. I'm talking about, you know, the essence. What can a man give in exchange for his soul? What does it profit about if it gains your wealth? And that's what we are talking about. If it is in exchange for living rights. That's what I'm saying. Not as if there's anything evil about them. What is it to him that is pure? Our peace are pure. But what we are looking at, our burden for life. What we hear is a call to the fundamental division. A call to a holy life. That there are just two categories of people. And so we are sharing along this line. That's why we are talking in this direction. We are not saying that equanimities, they are evil. But we are saying that when they become inescapable, for the cause, to our higher calling, then we are not wise. Because we are looking at their nature. The nature of these things. Ah? I remember a young lady. Who doesn't want to lose the chances. Said they are both believers. I wonder whether the boy is such an old believer anyway. Or whether she too really knows what she believes. And the boy insisted on premarital sex. And we said, no no no no no no. Especially in that case. We are going to break this relationship. On a big relationship, you don't, you don't. I'm going to, you know, you know. you know you know you know forget about that okay okay okay you know you know i don't want to say somewhere you know uh we'll have a broken relationship okay don't worry i will not say do okay let's do it and then they went ahead and call me the foundation because she doesn't want to lose the young man but you know the funny thing and the young man never married her he married somebody else that's the pathetic i'm talking about trying to possess ethnic riches she doesn't want to lose somebody for the sake of jesus he prefer to lose jesus and gain a brother i mean just a brother oh do you know how many do you know how many david will replace all for every giver there is a matthias taking the reality of it you do not want to lose a brother but you treat the way jesus i think if you have if you have heads to jesus jesus will have given you a brother he's good good job like giving you better if that brother is better god will have given you best see the old jesus turned out and the brother thing went his own way i married somebody else well you know i said look people look at now the summary of the young man is gone he wanted to win him to throw away jesus say now you have lost him both side no game you didn't get me you didn't gain jesus but if you have gained jesus you actually nothing would have been lost what about when you think that let us let us know who we are huh never the inheritance reserved for us in heaven huh you say we are kept by the power of god through faith for salvation to be revealed in the last days in this you greatly rejoice do you know that hey the reason why many people hey are dying because nigeria is dying is that their hope is in nigeria someone already having a potential hey they said ah they said there's no opportunity to agree with them they said there's no opportunity to agree with them they get to go out of the country ah hey they said and they're just that do you know why because the sight of who they are and what where they are going to he said in this you greatly rejoice when you see men right no source of infinite joy is on this material they don't know who they are mark my word i'm talking of innate joy when you see people no source of innate there is something about anybody we have been brought into this hope the sort of ultimate joy is not in material it's nothing it's not a material there is a great that is why you can see why the apostles can say um being justified by faith we have what peace with god and then he went on he said we also rejoice in tribulation knowing that tribulation was not patience men will have this joy and they can rejoice in tribulation there is this joy there is this thing when he said you know rejoice in the lord always there is this thing not because there There are no external press, not because there are no material press, not because there are no press here and there, but there is tea, there is something. You will be asking, Nigeria kono wanin ya bo bon koto soni? I don't know what is going on in Nigeria, I don't know what is going on on this planet. We are here, but we have a living hope. There is something that can make you to greatly rejoice, it is a joy, eh, that cannot be taken from you. Why? Because the inheritance cannot be touched, it cannot fade away, eh. No kidnapper can get there, no bandit can get there. Are you understanding me? Ethnicity, religiosity, Islamization, Christianity, Sevaritism, Catalyzism, all the zin, zin, zin, all those evil zin that we normally teach in government. You know we tell government for many years. There are not many zin, zin, zin, that are evil. All those, none of them can get there. It cannot be stolen. It cannot be taken from you. You are so true it is reserved for you. And because you are, you have this thing in you, there is this thing, there is this, oh, you know, when this is over, knowing that your actual inheritance cannot be touched, is something that should give you joy. But when you don't know about this inheritance, eh, when the, when the temple inheritance are touched, eh, you start dying. You start having hypertension. You start having, are you understanding me? That is what is happening. That is why sometimes I wonder, how do believers commit suicide? How do believers commit, what happened? What happened? What were they taught? What do they believe in? Do believers go into, how do they go into depression? We are not saying there is no tribulation. Please understand what I am trying to say. When we are saying that, if we really know who we are, eh, we can rejoice in tribulation. That is why some of you like James can tell us again, thank you, it's all God. When you fall into what? Not just tribulation, no. When you fall into what? Diverse tribulation. I am going to read verse and say, are you in many problems, then be happy. I am going to read verse and put it that way, whether it is the New Living Translation or the Old Living Translation. That is James chapter 1. He said, are you, you know, are you in plenty trouble, then be happy. What they are saying is not that they are sick people, they are not human beings. They are not living in pain. Are you understanding me? You talk of pain, you talk of pain. Paul said, even this exponent one is dying. No, they were going through things. Eh, we talk about his affliction in fasting also. In perish of thieves, perish of robbers, perish of ... They are not spiritual, they are not spiritual, they knew pain, but there was something down, down, down. That is what we are talking about. You know, what I am trying to make you see, that I am going somewhere. I am going somewhere. Eh? There is this deep-seated understanding. Eh? From which holiness springs. I want to show you that holiness, holy conduct. Eh? They are seated, you know, it has a two-legged pillar. And I want to show you those two-legged pillars. I am addressing the first one now gradually. Eh? The first leg to holiness is understanding who we are and what has been given to us. That is what I am handling. There is a hundred major legs. A hundred very, very fundamental ones. This one is to us God. The God God God has given us. He has made us. Where we are going, the more we are conscious of that, the more we see that, the more we know that, the more we realize that, the more we understand, the more we believe. Because I want to quickly take you to something. Let's just go down to that place where we talked about holiness. Look at it. I want to show you something about holiness. Say, for being holy, or I am a holy, I want to show you something about holiness. Look at that verse 15. Where it talks about our topics of taking it from verse 15. When we look at verse 15, it says, But as he who called you is holy, Be ye holy in what? All your conduct. Some say manners of conduct. Isn't it? Be ye holy. What I want to make you see. Righteousness. Righteousness is positional. We don't do anything to become righteous. It is a gift. Are you understanding me? I have never tried to be righteous. I know that I am righteous. Because it's a gift. Once you get born again, the gift that you are given is abundant grace and the gift of righteousness. So righteousness is impeded by Jesus. The law demands righteousness. Grace impedes righteousness. Righteousness is positional. So we don't need to try to be righteous. We are righteous people. Positionally. But it's about conduct. It's about conduct. How you conduct yourself. It says, Be ye holy in all your conduct. Your conduct. Your conduct. Positionally you are righteous. We are talking about holiness. We are talking about your conduct in life. What is about conduct? Conduct yourself. How do you carry your life? What are the things you involve your hand with? What are the things you say? What are the things you do? That's why we are talking about holiness. So holiness is a matter is not something that is inherited. It is something that's supposed to be a product of what we have been given. God gave us grace and righteousness so that we can be holy. So that our conduct can be correct. Are you getting it now? So he gave us. He did it for action. It's something that has been given. You know what I'm trying to bring out? It's about conduct. So as we look into 2023 we are talking about conduct. That there is a way those who are in Christ who have hope who know who they are who know where they are going who know what is reserved for them who know the nature of what has been reserved there is a way they conduct themselves different from the way those who are oppressed those who enjoy is here with what is reserved for them everything is here all their hope all their expectations those who cannot feel this eternity there is a way they conduct themselves we can know them they can turn life to get a job they can for the sake of anything enter into any kind of relationship with anybody no matter whether it affects the Lord or not they can do anything like somebody was I'm saying that because of this thing they were talking about they were talking about this I don't know how true I'm not it's just a reported story a so called sitha that was the story was going out with you know somebody of the other faith analogy and when they were questioned huh about the matter of a new poor yoke huh they look as believers we should be careful in our conduct in everything everything we do let's all be careful we don't understand huh one will be taken and the other left what it means is that even if we marry unbeliever on that day the believer will be taken the unbeliever will be left so it's not only about a new poor yoke if you understand the revelation in that case I know that it is true that he actually said that but my concern is those the reason why she conducted herself that way if she is a believer huh is a signal that it is either she is not in this hope or she cannot see this hope she cannot see it because that is actually what John said he said they are not born of God or they don't know God it is either of them so we are talking about conduct all this is about conduct how you conduct yourself people will have this hope people will know where they are going that is the way they conduct themselves so that the what I am drawing you to this evening is this I want to stop at I want to get you I want to get you guys to stop I want to get you guys to stop because it is time it is time you need to know I don't want to make the world a mess I want to make everything a mess let us do the work of the Lord and you should of the end of peace. Eh? Many are the afflictions of the righteous but from them hold the Lord deliverance eh? Matthew 7 eh? The man who hear my word. The rain still came. The wind blew. The flood came. Didn't take away the house. It depends that it did not fall. The one who disobeyed. Depends that the house fell. But whether you hear and you obey or you hear and you disobey. Nothing takes away what? The storm. The rain. The rain. Believers are not immune from life challenges. Yeah. If you know that approach it will not happen. Two things they are fables. They are lies. They are not spiritual. Believers can go to shabbos. Get that clear. It is taught to me that sometimes you may not even have money to pay your house rent. It is taught to me that sometimes you don't have money to pay your school fees. It is taught that sometimes you are you are sick and you don't even know what to do someday there's even no need to eat. And I wonder what is going to happen. It's possible. Believer is kidnapped. It's possible. Yeah. They are not kidnapped here. They are not they are they are supposed to be Godly people. It should not happen to them. So I hear people talking and I just keep wondering. It's not true. They are giving us false impression about the life of a believer. Paul Paul mentioned in the parables of Paul's brethren. In the parables of Robert. In the parables of God. It could happen. The believer cannot have challenge. Go and check what he said. Eh it's if your brother was poor. Probably the believer cannot challenge. There was there was no in the life of Joe. When he when he went down from that ides to that zero. Everything to be justice. Jesus was loved by God and yet the way he died was the injustice in life. Because God has a purpose in it. So God cannot have a purpose in it is the injustice you suffer. companijustice. And God is with you and God is with you. God is with you. And God is with you. Amen. важ strengthened of marriage and God is with you. God sod the earth is the greatest principle of life and we will see if that is in him and you know it comes out and you will pray for him because you are married your first birthday. And God is with you. When Joseph entered into prison, God was with him. God was part of the imprisonment. God was the one that made everything and he was in that prison. So, here is the way you should begin to feel the life of a believer. Maybe I'm not too serious. People tell you that in Jesus, it's once you enter into Jesus, all your sorrow is gone. That is when we begin to see challenging, to go and commit suicide. Jesus must have gone. We told you that Jesus left. Jesus never left. Jesus was there. He said, when you are in the water, I will be with you. Be found. I will be with you. All of that. If you need be, we may go through troubles. Let's get our heart prepared. Let's set our heart. Let's understand who we are. Let us understand what could possibly be. And let us live in infirmities. Let's believe in the reality of what the Bible says. The first bottom line to the matter of holiness is what we are looking at now. Do you understand who you are? Do you believe I am holy? Do you know who you are? Do you understand your background? Do you know where you are coming from? It is closing prayers. It is closing prayers. This evening, I want you to talk to the Lord. I don't know what you have learned this evening, but I want you to talk to the Lord. Please talk to the Lord. Talk to the Lord, talk to the Lord. talk to the lord i want you to just alter some things to the lord say some things to the lord what are you understanding what are you seeing what are you what are you what are you hearing what are you what is coming into your heart what has been what is how is this not coming to you be you holy for i am holy you cannot get into that if you don't first know who you are understand who you are understand your background know your antithesis know your origin know where you are coming from or else this life will confuse you they will carry you here and there if you don't know what you are standing for then you will search for anything but if you know what you are standing for you can have your son for anything let me invite my wife to close this meeting now please come and pray pray for us close this meeting this evening father jesus name we are grateful unto you lord for speaking to us again thank you lord for the topic the message reminding us again about the responsibility our home path in the great work of salvation you are done you are freely giving us all that we need for life and godliness and it is our duty to war and to please us for the sake of this spiritual life and to MERIT, impregnating us and our soul and doing everything so that all of us can come after you and those that you love ourselves the conflicts that we are a part of our lives to be faithful and aware no matter how big that trance away the norm is to appear more to appropriately placing our lives and one of the ways is by holy conduct being holy being intentional about our conduct spoken to us thank you for reminding us again now we pray oh lord as we go in this might as we go with this great word of deliverance lord we shall go forth and lead thereby in the name of jesus this world will not stand against us rather lord the water that has been sent into our heart will bring forth fruits lord our heart oh lord we will make the best use of this world this world will not be destroyed rather it will bring forth the life of christ in the name of jesus which will make us a better believer he will go to need the life of holiness he will be customized to for pay attention to our conduct our behavior it will make us to remember remember to tune in any times and guide our ways along the streets in the name of jesus now we pray you will help us no receive the strength and the power Lord, to go forth and live according to this law that you've spoken to us in Jesus' name.

That, Lord, you will keep flowing through this channel. Lord, we pray you will not be corrupted. Lord, we pray, Lord, Jehovah God, the source which is you, can never go dry. He will keep connecting to you, Lord, in Jesus' name. Thank you for all our brethren that are not here, those online, we pray your blessings will be upon them. We pray, Lord, you will not recover, Lord, from this world, from this impartation, unto the life of Christ, the very purpose of which it has been sent, but fulfilled in us in Jesus' name. The devil will resist you in the name. In the name of Jesus, we say we have been delivered by this truth in the name of Jesus. Thank you, everlasting Father, every day that has been removed tonight, we will not be in ignorance, Lord, and begin to pack it together again in the name of Jesus. We say it has been removed in the name of Jesus. It has been removed in the name of Jesus. I will go forth seeing, having understanding of the word of God in Jesus' name. Thank you, everlasting Father. For in Jesus' name we pray. The grace and fellowship, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with us now and forevermore. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.

      "{\"source_url\": \"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7cK-ixTuntDd19uRjNDZnFocGM&export=download\", \"transcription\": \"Okay. Praise the Lord. I said, as we look at the ministry of justification, the ministry of condemnation last week, we began to see some very, very serious matters. And I said, when I got home, I was just meditating on something. And look at what came out of this meditation. Just trying to move from where we left the matter last week to Isaiah. Where we'll be looking at, that's what we'll be looking at very, we'll really dwell on today. Now look at, look at Psalm 91 verse 3. Compare with Exodus chapter 23 verse 25. Psalm 91 verse 3. Okay. Compare with Exodus 23 verse, Exodus 23 verse, verse, let me read Psalm 91 verse 3 here. Psalm 91 verse 3, reads something like, it says, Surely, He will deliver you from the sin of the fowler. There's a commentary, there's a small write-up on that. That is, one who catches a bird in a trap or snare. And from the perilous pestilence. In Exodus 23, 25. Exodus 23, 23, 25. He says, So, you shall serve the Lord your God and He will bless your bread and your water and I will take away sickness from the midst of you. What do you notice? What do you notice? As I read that scripture in the course of the week. Look at, look at, let me read to you my meditation. I said, it just occurs to me, following from the things that we have been discussing. I've been studying the Psalms. It says, under the of the law, God said, you will serve the Lord your God and He shall bless your bread and water and I will take sickness from your midst. In Psalm 91 verse 3, it said, I will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and then, and also from what? The perilous pestilence. And I said, this was the ultimate that the ministry of condemnation that is the law will offer man. Good health was a promise. But the blessedness of the ministry of justification that is grace and truth says, but it was wounded for our transgression. It was bruised through our guilt and iniquities. The chastisement needful to obtain peace and well-being for us was upon Him. And with His stripes that wounded Him we are healed and made whole. Psalm 63 verse 5 And I said, thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift. Good health is an inheritance and grace. You know, as we try to look at Isaiah chapter 53 today, I want you to look at Isaiah chapter 53 with a very very open heart. Let's get to the scripture and let's trust the Lord to meet with us. Now look at Isaiah chapter 53. Isaiah 53 very very popular scripture just about I think it should just be about 11 verses. 11 or 12 verses. How many verses? About 12 verses. Yeah. And it's a very very short chapter. But it contains so much. Now in opening that chapter the Bible says something that looks like a thing that cause for us to really ponder. The Bible says who has believed our reports and to whom has the harm of the Lord been revealed? For it shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground. He has no form nor commonness and when we see him there is no beauty and we should desire him. He is despised and rejected by men. A man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and we did not esteem him. Surely he bore our grief and carried our sorrows yet we esteemed him not. We esteemed his preaching smitten by God and afflicted. Then he was wounded for our transgression. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray and we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord has laid on him his own way. He has oppressed he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth. He was led as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before its shearers in silence so he opened not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment and who will declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living by people he was shrinking. And they made his grave with the wicked but with the rich at his death. Because he has done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth yet he pleased the Lord to bruise him. He has put him to grief when he made his soul an offering for sin. He shall see he shall see he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the labor of his soul and be satisfied. Amen. By his knowledge my righteous servant shall justify many by his knowledge my righteous servant shall justify many for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide his portion with the strong. Because he poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bore the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors. Brethren You know the first thing How will you describe the fulfillment of this prophecy? How will you describe the fulfillment of this prophecy that was just read? One hundred percent That's a description What other way can we describe it? That's a description which is very true It was fulfilled one hundred percent Can we see other things about the nature of the fulfillment of this prophecy? Yes I'm listening now I want us to talk I'm listening to us The fulfillment of this prophecy How will you describe it? Somebody said it was one hundred percent fulfilled That's true What other way of describing it? It's about Jesus the Messiah Yes Think about the prophecy What can you say? What can you say about it? Particularly with the fulfillment In respect of the fulfillment Yes We have not seen the fulfillment of this thing in our generation In time of hell In terms of the promises that are there We have not seen it being fulfilled in our life That's what we are looking at it to I want you to look at it from the point of Maybe I can narrow it further The fulfillment of this promise by Jesus Somebody said it's one hundred percent Which is true What other description can we give it? Look at how Jesus came Look at what he did Look at how he died All of those things Look at these things that were said here That's what I'm trying to say How will you describe it? That's what I'm looking for Do you notice that it is exact? Does it not make you afraid? He will be numbered with the transgressors Yet at his grave He will be with the rich Do you understand what I'm trying to bring out? It was the grave of a rich man He said He was numbered That is If I don't know See That is why The spirit of prophecy Needs that we have it We understand it In all wisdom And spiritual understanding You get the point I'm making You know That is a point people have sometimes God told me this thing He said Look yes But be careful You need to understand what God is saying In all wisdom And spiritual understanding When you are doing this thing You need to sit down and say God how does it How does it go How does it go You know Just like when they told Mary that He will give birth to his son And will sit on the throne of his father David They will call him the son of God They were thinking that everything will happen But between when he was called the son of God And then will come and sit on the throne of his father David They didn't think that he will first die There will be so many years in between Even Mary will have died All of them will have died You see And so That is why they keep on saying Will you at this time restore the kingdom You will see the star You see look Don't bother yourself Because What God was saying You know They didn't understand it in all wisdom And spiritual understanding You know That is why as God speaks to us It needs wisdom And spiritual understanding But That is just a response to what God said about how many people were at his death Now so we saw that They said Like a lamb before its shearer It will be silent As you read the account Between him and Pilate What makes Pilate Why we say Pilate You know Exceedingly He marveled exceedingly What makes Pilate to marvel He said because he uttered Don't you hear what everybody is saying See But Are you That The word I am looking for Is that you will notice that The The How would I put it The minutest details Of this prophecy Eh Was fulfilled Exactly The way it was said In time That is the first thing I want you to see What What gets me What gets me wondering again Eh Is the fact that You know We were talking about chastisement What led to What led to Chastising Jesus Look at the incident that led to it Okay Pilate was looking for a way to free him He said okay by the time I will beat him That way If I bring him out I think he has been punished That was his own mind So that I can give you To set him free But as they were doing that To do that It was just What I want you to see is that Look at the way Look at the way Divine hand Can move mortals Both in intention And in And in inclinations And in emotions And in psychology In judgement In reasoning To bring about A divine cancer Even when Even when these mortals Were not aware Of these prophecies They don't know the scripture They don't know God But God have a divine mind And God want that mind To be achieved And God To move through You know If you go and check several other ones The detail sometimes makes me afraid He said You know He will be born in Bethlehem How was he born in Bethlehem Suddenly Augustus Caesar just said Everybody should go to their town To be numbered Go you must be in your own village They could take sense from anywhere Go to country in your village And they went there to be counted And there in that place Just when Jesus Was about to be born What I am saying What I am showing you Is The first thing That gripped my heart In this scripture Is the oxoness of God Our God is oxon Our God is oxon And the oxon The oxoness I first want you to see You know Apostle Paul said something He said having this confidence He said Since we have this kind of hope We speak how And with confidence I want to show you what these people saw He said they spoke Confidently and they spoke plainly They can say it Look they were too plain They were too bold about the matter Now The first thing That I want to grip I want you to see Is the fact that There was a divine mind An evil man Who does not know God Who does not respect God Who wanted to act against God Who felt they are acting Within their power Within whatever they think they have And they can do They were just busy fulfilling The need The gritty details Of God What I want to make you see Is that If the fulfillment Of this Of these promises Of these prophecies By Christ Hmm One Was precise Two Was exact Three Was complete Four Was total Could it be That the promises attached to them Would not be exact Could it be that those suffering That went through exactly The consequence of them Would not be exact If the suffering The specification of those things Were They were precise They were exact And they were total Could it be that God Do not intend That the consequences of this suffering God didn't intend That they should be exact They should be precise They should be complete And total Could it be That if God could move The wicked And move the sinners And did everything Despite all the Those who were men That were in the hand of the devil They were not his children But God could move both the devil Could move all his cause Could move all his men Could use them to accomplish A divine mind Could God be limited In accomplishing The revenge For that suffering Could have made All those movements Could he have moved Those things Could he have done it so exactly Could he have done it so precisely And yet He never intended That the consequences should be real Could it be Or could it be that somewhere Somehow we were deceived Could it be that somewhere Somehow we were misled Could it be that somewhere Somehow we heard another gospel But these are the issues It is a matter That Baba has been raising in my heart Over and over and over The thing is that You see that we are limiting God You say it is not possible I say it is possible There are two specific references in scripture That shows That his own Eh They could have in a way That would make God Not to make his promises To manifest in their life So take your mind back To what happened to Jesus In Nazareth Are you familiar with the story In Nazareth Are you familiar with the story Or we should read it Yes they said Is he not the son of Jacob So how did the bible now conclude That is what I want He could not do it He came to do it He came to do it But is he not Is he not the Is he not the Who will bring God down from heaven How are we sure if we pray God will answer If we declare what religion Hey if I lay my hands on this person Will the demon go Hey I don't know now Are you understanding me He could not Not because he did not He came he wanted I am trying to make you understand that Do you know that We can be in affliction We have promises Not to take effect Even though he has promised us Let me read one scripture to you Can we just pray a little Can you just pray Can you just pray a little Can you just pray a little Can you just say God Help me to save It is only him That can do this thing in our hearts It is only him I am telling you It is only him that can move You see he walked in us Both to will and to do Of his good pleasure Can you say God This new thing you want to start This fulfillment Of your promises And the life of your people This lifting away of your affliction This entrance into that Which you just have made And made available for us Lord walk in me Both to will Lord walk in me do. Make me perfect in this good work to do your will. Work in me this which is well-pleasing in your sight. Lord, work in me. Lord, work in me that which is well-pleasing in your sight. Lord God, help me to see you. Let every veil of fear, veil of doubt, veil of unbelief, veil of ignorance, veil of God's removal. Lord, release me into what you are doing. Lord, set me free. Lord, I break my limitations today. I break limitations. I break whatever is limiting me. I go beyond my limitations. I grow wings to fly. I grow wings, Lord, by the working of your Spirit, not by power, not by master, but by the working of your mighty power. By the working of your mighty power. By the working of your mighty power. By the working of your mighty power. By the working of your mighty power. Lord, build your church according to your word. Lord, build your church. Lord, build your church. Lord, build your church. Lord, build your church. Our limitations take us beyond those things that hold us down. Lord, take us beyond those things that keep us down. Lord, take us from us to break and get loose. It is liberty that Christ has set us free. For where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Lord, the liberty that comes by the Spirit. The liberty, the liberty to follow God. The liberty to lean on God. The liberty to rest on God. The liberty to hold to God. The liberty to walk in what God has said. The liberty to stand on what God has spoken. The liberty to follow what God has... Lord, help us. Lord, help us. We dearly need your help. We dearly need your intervention. Lord, we don't know what we have believed. We don't know exactly what happened to us. We don't even know when exactly it happened. But somehow, Lord, there is more to what you have done for us than we are seeing. There is more to what you have done for us than we are experiencing. There is a liberty which Christ has set us free. Thank you, Holy Spirit. Blessed be your name, Lord. Blessed be your name. Blessed be your name, Lord. Blessed be your name. Thank you, Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Let's continue. Let's see Psalm 78. Let's see Psalm 78. We'll come back to where we are reading. Let's see Psalm 78. Psalm 78. Are you there? Now look at Psalm 78. Let's take our reading from the exact verse I'm going to. It's verse 41. But I want us to I want us to read it from from verse from verse 38. Are you there from verse from verse 35? Are you there? Then they remembered that God was their rock and the Most High God was their Redeemer. Nevertheless, they flattered Him with their mouth. And they lied to Him with their tongue. For their heart was not steadfast with Him. I want you to be noting this thing. I'm talking about unbelief. What God called flattered. Take it again from 36. Nevertheless, they flattered Him with their tongue. With their mouth. Because some people don't know what they're saying. Nevertheless, they flattered Him with their mouth. They lied to Him with their tongue. For their heart was not steadfast with Him. Nor were they faithful to His covenant. But He being full of compassion forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Yes, many a time He turned His anger away and did not tear up all His wrath. For He remembered that they were but flesh. A breath that passes away and does not come again. 40, 41. How often how often they provoke Him in the wilderness and greet Him in the desert. Yes, again and again they tempted God and limited the only one of Israel. How did they do it? They did not remember His power. Are you following me? They did not remember His power. The day when He redeemed them from the enemy. When He worked His signs in Egypt. His wonders in the field of Zion. Turned their rivers into blood. And their strings that they could not drink. He sent swans of flies among them which devoured them. And frogs which destroyed them. He also gave their crock to the caterpillar. And their lapper to the locust. He destroyed their vines with hail. And their sycamore trees with frost. He also gave up their castles to the hail. And their flock to fearing lighting. He cast on them the fierceness of His anger. Rocking the nation and trouble. By sending angels of destruction among them. He made a path for His anger. He did not spare their souls from death. He gave their life over them. He gave their life over to the plague. And destroyed all the firstborn in Egypt. The first of their strength in the tent of Ham. But He made His own people go forth like sheep. And guided them in the wilderness like a flock. And He led them unsafely. So they did not fear. But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. And He brought them to the holy borders. This mountain which is His right hand. Which His right hand had acquired. He drove out the nations from before them. Allotted them an inheritance by survey. And made the tribe of Israel dwell in their tents. Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God. And did not keep His testimony. They turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers. They were turned aside like a defeatful bull. Huh? Are you getting? Are you getting? What is it that provoked God about these people? What did they not remember? They did not remember His power. And which power is He asking them to remember? Which power? The power that He used to redeem them. What I meant to make you see is that there is so much about salvation. I am not talking about a new power. I am not talking about a... Frederick was talking about... We don't... Who would believe. God is not talking about a new power. God is not talking about a power that is going to make to come down. The power came down And they saw it. And so He expected them. To do what? To believe that power. It puts to you brethren. I am talking about how we limit God. I am talking about limiting God. I am talking about limiting God. I told you the first lesson. that Jesus himself couldn't do anything. I think that God himself again was limited. He wanted to just swipe up those people. Call them Walele and Kanon. Hey, we Kanon. God is God. Let him give us meat. Can he give us meat? He can only give bread. Let us see if he can give us meat. He gave them meat but he killed them. It goes on that point again. If he's God, let him bring water. Can he bring water out of the rock? He brought us again. It goes to the point. Ah, in fact, he about to destroy us. Okay, this time, I swear to all of you, we died. I said so. That is not what he intended to do. But that was the consequence of... those were the consequences of not believing in his power. They didn't believe his power. Those things were mere consequences. And what's... do you know what what the Lord is... do you know what the Lord is telling over and over again in the recent times? He said these things, they were written down for your learning so that you don't lost after what they lost. You know what they want you to do, right? They want... they want you to be a faithful servant of God and follow what God said after. So you don't do what they did. They brought... the Bible says that... the Bible says that... see let's... we'll come back to Isaiah. Look at Hebrews, Hebrews. Let's go to the New Testament, let's see something about the record in Hebrews. Let's see something in let's see something there let me even open let me open my I want to open another bible let me open this NIV bible please I'm coming let's see Hebrews chapter 3 and then chapter 4 Hebrews now please let's take you through reading chapter 4 from verse 1 look at the reading therefore since the promise of entering into Israel still stands we shall all enter the rest of God in every area of our life in every area that's where God has prepared for us we will enter into it in the name of Jesus therefore since the promise of entering into Israel still stands let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it for we also have heard the good news proclaimed to us just as they did but the message they heard was of no value to them because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed it did not mix with faith it did not mix with faith in their hearts now we who are believers enter that rest just as God said so I declare on oath in my anger they shall never enter my rest and yet its work has been finished since the creation of the world for somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in which on this world on this earth on this earth on this earth on this earth on this earth on this earth on this earth on this earth on this earth the seventh day God rested from all its work he says and again in this passage above he says they shall never enter my rest therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their own belief eh do you notice that some translation called unbelief disobedience do you follow me some say unbelief some says what disobedience so most of the time unbelief and disobedience they go hand in hand what you don't believe you will not obey now he says because of sorry because of their own belief he says God will not obey you God again said a certain day calling it today this he did when a long time later he spoke to David as in the passage already quoted today if you will hear his voice do not harden your heart so what is the new thing that God has prepared for this power what is the new set time that God has prepared today are you following me at all if you preach the gospel now and somebody believe will it be saved can you say no Jesus cannot save him today what he is saying is that any movement at any point where any man stand up on this promise it becomes a reality God has taken the matter to a matter of today why is it why is it today because it is no more a promise to be fulfilled it is a promise that has been fulfilled he says so just before I go on in this verse 7 I want to ask you this question all of us sitting here as believers let's be very practical if somebody asks you right now if I believe Jesus now will he save me what will you tell the person why do you say are you sure do you doubt do you doubt whether Jesus can save the person what he says I want to repent please show me the way to Jesus Jesus cannot you see you need to you need to you need to you need to you need to you need to you need to you need to you need to you need to do some fasting you see you need to to experience this salvation there are certain things you need to do will you is there anything about this salvation do you doubt do you doubt it in your heart do you doubt Jesus saving at any instant somebody come to say Jesus please save me what happens to the other things in Jesus I also do it yes are you sure that God wants to save when you pray why why why why why why why why why why why why Are you Are you Are you See the problem These are things that God must help us These are things that God must help us You see We have limited God in some things We have cornered him to a place You see This sign shall follow them that believe Only when I want to do it Did he say so As long as he goes This sign shall follow them that believe In my name They will lay their hands on the sick The sick shall recover He said no go But do you see where we are not going We say how are we sure it is God's will I am just trying to make you see Matters God is living with me myself I am not presenting this matter to you As somebody who have attained I am presenting matters As everyone is challenging my heart As he still is a generation I am also listening to your mentioned matters It is the Mother who has put a word on your heart I am listening to your words I am listening to your words I am listening to your words I am listening to your words These are the issues the Lord is living in my own heart What have happened to the gospel And that is why I say this So that I wanted you to read and meditate If you will come back You might have also seen something that I did not see About what you will share with me Before that challenges my heart But I am showing you what I saw. And I am showing you the questions that have been written in my own spirit. God could go to the fulfillment. It was too exact. If God don't really mean to bring the consequences of those things. At a point, he was saying, God, God, it mustn't be this cup. If you are willing, lay this cup. If God don't really intend the consequences of the cup. Why brother make the son go through all those details? Thrive will not bring peace to us. Then why brother let them flog him? If it is a judgment, will not bring healing. Then why Gideon has to suffer it? Could God be, could God be very light in his intention? Has God ceased to be deliberate? You see, you see, I am leaving this matter and you go back to your own closes. And face God. The thing is that, we are living in a generation who want God to be bothered about the things bothering them. But they are not bothered about what is bothering God. We don't understand that it bothers God when His people limit Him. When God's people limit God, it bothers God. All who think it was the joy of God to say all of it that I brought out. I will not kill all of you. It was a joy. It was a joy. Have you? Yes. You thought it was His joy to be killing them. You thought it was His joy not to make His promises come to pass. According to what He told them. Do you think it was His joy that they limited Him? If it was His joy, why is He doing everything not to show the fullness of His wrath? Why is He doing everything? Okay, okay. I will kill you but your children will go. He still wants the thing. Okay, okay. I can't do this thing. To tell you that He still wants to show that I can bring people there. When God says, I can do it. And because of terminating the journey. He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. Because He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. He said, no. Instead He said, no. But they limited Him. As I read the scripture. You know... See, look at what the Bible says. Let's move on for! You see, verse 7, let me read on again. You see, God again set a certain day, calling it today. This He did when a long time later, He spoke to David as in the passage already quoted, today! If you will hear His voice, you know how it is... For if Joshua Had given them rest God would not again have spoken later About another day There remains then a Sabbath rest For the people of God For anyone who Enter God rest Also rest From their works Just as God did from his work Let us therefore make every effort To enter that rest So that no one Will perish by following the examples Of disobedience For the word of God Please What does the Bible say about the word of God For the word of God is what It's alive And active Sharper than any two words Word It penetrates even to the dividing soul And spirit And joint and marrows It just gives the thought And the attitude of the earth Nothing in all creation Is hidden from God's sight Everything is uncovered and left bare Before his eye To whom we must give account Therefore We have a great high priest Who ascended into heaven Jesus The son of God Let us hold firmly to the faith We profess We profess This is what we are trying to say Are you getting the matter Are you getting the matter Eh The matter is not only that Jesus Has fulfilled the condition The matter is that He is still alive Washing over God Performing them He is still alive Praying and interceding He has not just gone He has fulfilled it Eh And then we still have him Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until Until This is the reason why we must hold firmly to the faith we profess. Why it must be a firm thing. Why it must be a thing we can put our hearts on. But you know many times, we always think that this is only in the matter of living holy, living righteously. We don't see it in the privileges that it gave us. Are you understanding me? Let me hold fast not to sin. Let me hold fast. Yes, He did that. But He also did several other things that if you hold fast, you will get them. Are you getting the point I am making? Salvation is a comprehensive thing. And that was a problem our fathers had. He brought them out. He did mighty things to bring them out. Just like that. He did a mighty thing to save us. They did not understand that that is not just all about it. The only thing you can know is power. That as you begin to move on, you begin to make reference to that thing. Begin to make reference. You begin to make reference. As you meet with things, you make reference to what redeemed you. As you meet with things, you make reference. That is why the Bible says we should be planted and built up in Christ. Don't get planted and then built up in some other things, in traditions, in common sense. No. You are planted. You haven't been rooted in Him. You are supposed to what? To also be built on Him. But what I discover today is like we take root, like our brother said, salvation is general. But every other thing, we begin to wait for when God wills. When God wills. The point I am making is that. Even if the truth is that we are even waiting for when He wills. That is one thing. Another thing is that. Check several times. We don't believe His power. We doubt His power. We doubt. We doubt. We doubt that certain things have been done. We doubt it. We, we, we, we. Either way. They insist in both. The point I am pressing further. Yes. Is that the Bible says, let us hold firmly to the faith. And I want to ask you, what is the faith? The faith is what we are looking at in the book of Isaiah, brethren. That is the faith. Because, let's see. Let's go back to Isaiah where we left the matter. Let's go back to Isaiah. Can we go back to Isaiah? Did you notice that? The opening of that, of that, of that chapter. Began with something that we commonly read. My own translation says. Who has believed our message? To whom has the hand of the Lord been revealed? On that translation. Who has believed what you have heard? And who thinks that the hand of the Lord has been revealed? Which translation is that? The resurrection of Jesus. To whom has the hand of the Lord been revealed? On that translation. Which translation? Easy English. Easy English. What does it say? It almost seems that nobody has believed our message. It almost seems that nobody has seen the hand of the Lord. It almost seems that nobody has seen the hand of the Lord. Is that not true? Is that not true? On that translation. Who has believed our message? To whom has the Lord revealed his powerful hand? Are you following something brethren? Now, this message that the, the, the, the Holy Spirit is raising in the heart of this prophet. Huh? What message is this, is the message? You know the message of the gospel? Because subsequently he said he grew up before him like a tender plant. That is the message he asked him that we want to believe. He want to, you see that, as the foundation of the gospel, the question that Baba first asked humanity is who we believe. When the, when, when the Lord was fulfilling this matter, check it again. He said, look, as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up. Eh? He said that whosoever believes might be saved. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son. That fall was coming from a flow that looked just the way Moses lifted up that serpent in the wilderness. It's what God is going to do again to conquer the devil. To conquer affliction. To conquer death. To conquer everything. It's going to be by a lifting up. So everybody that can look and ignore every other thing. He said, for God. Did you see that it was the same premise that the Lord raised with humanity again? Are we not so scared by the activities of the serpent today? The raising of his head. The bites that he has bitten us. The death. The way there were, there are many. The sins. The death. He said, he said that. Is there not where sentient is rounding is going round? Ha! Hey! I want to get. Ha! Huh! Tupak not. Hey! Whoa! Huh! Dog. Wow! Huh! consolation. I made no false . The way we shake. When we see somebody say, very very now. The way you be shaking. You will not shake like that. When the Father of God says, I'm with you. Your heart is not as strong. Even though you. Even if you want to counter. Hey! Something is jumping. Hey! you have more confidence in that thing that the person is doing than what you are carrying the the matter the matter the matter i'm raising with you it's a matter of the lord keep emphasizing over and over in my spirit he says so look the matter is you will hear not knowing the scripture it is it is it is it 20 you must know you must know the scripture and you must know my power you must not limit my power and please please brethren in hebrews chapter 4 that we read what is that power say the word of god is what is quick it is equal to when we take this word and you notice the same thing flowing out from isaiah chapter 53 the first question is what who will believe before the revelation of what the harm what is that harm what is the harm the power say i will save you by my mighty hand i will carry you by my hand i will pull you out by my hand i will do that by my hand with my right hand i will draw you is that not but what is the first thing before the harm who will believe the report then for that testing there will be what a revelation of his arm do you know the same thing in the wilderness he wants it bites you if you believe the reports and you look up what will happen there will be a revelation of what of his hand to deal with the venom but if you don't believe the reports will there be a revelation of his arm but you see that we want one the other way around we want to see his arm and then believe the report who we believe now you will notice that if heaven want to raise a matter and heaven is asking a question who we believe if god wants to start a matter with his people and god begin by saying that tala for you bro does he not bring something to your mind that generally i didn't say you know you understand i can't say anything about the knowledge that god will give you is asking but he's asking you how will he ever know about possessing, how will he get past the law? so if you are you just shut up and start protests company fold your access it is i'm going to say to you that this is the爸 and mr there is the Father's truth is what Armwijn does not tell you what to do you say stop side.. ..... eh But the question is, who will believe? Who? Who will believe the report? Who will believe this report? Who will believe this report if you can take this report? And you know, you know, then we will experience the harm of the Lord. But we see His harm. The harm of God to redeem, to save, is there. Then He now began to raise the gospel. He shall go up before Him like a tender plant. Who raised those matters gradually? He shall go up before Him like a tender plant. Why is He a root out of a dry ground? Let's look at those matters. I just want to, I just need a background for the matter we are looking into. I just need a platform. Please, I want you to go back. Please, look at this gospel. Pray to God to meet. Look at this gospel. Look at, look at the gospel. Check the gospel. Ask God. There is so much about this matter. Let us pray for today. Let's pray. Let's talk with the Lord for today. Thank you. I don't know what you have learned or what you have been challenged about. I don't know what you are saying. But I'm only raising matters with you as the Lord is raising them with me. I'm only showing you our generation. Are we not limiting God? Our generation? Are we sure we are not provoking His anger? Are you sure that what Jesus really wanted to do with us, He could not do that because we did not believe? Are you sure, are you, are you sure that the offer that heaven opened to you, this is the offer? Are you sure that all belief have not made some of the offer not to be there? You know, why not? You know, just, I don't know exactly, you know, there are different levels of our work with God. There are different levels of how God is dealing with us. So, I don't know how it came to you particularly, you know, what exactly the Lord is challenging in your work with Him. But whatever it may be challenging in your own work, that is what you should pray about. That is what you should lift up to Him. That is what you should say, Baba, this is the area. That area is what you should take again to the place of meditation as you look at Isaiah. And say, God, this matter, this area, this is my own area. This area, Lord, this area, how does it come up in this matter? How does it come up in the gospel? How does it show up, Lord? Save me from tradition. Save me from whatever is limiting me. Save me if I have been limited. Come work in me. Let there be a light. Let something make me fly. Let your spirit again work. If perhaps I want to be flying but I am still crawling, Lord, do something. This is the area I am pointing to you, Baba. Baba, this is the area. That is what I want us to do. Because of our different level of work with God. Baba, let's come to God in the area where the Holy Ghost is drawing, He is drawing a red light. He is pointing a search-light. He is searching something, an pointing at something. Come to God in that area. Come to see God in the area. Blessed be Your name. Blessed be Your name. Blessed be Your name. Blessed be Your name. Blessed be your name. Blessed be your name. Ah! Ah! Ah! Yopola Jogu Iku, Latodo Adamu Ah! Shibu Atirije, Latodo Jesu Oluwa Ah! Ogo Olomu, Fala Onibamba Binu Aye Mio, Fala Onibamba Ah!

Ogo Olomu, Fala Onibamba Binu Aye Mio, Oba Buja De And we need that in you, because we need that in one of us, which will lead us to the affliction of doubt or deletion. All that thou canst not find, let it be in the first world that you are taken to. Amen. And we will continue to know, step by step, okay? Amen. When you are taking a walk, this walk should be one of those feelings of peace with the Lord. And so we should try to experience the healing and the deliverance that the Lord has given to us. Amen. Amen. You bring the love of peace to the suffering and the pain of hope to this generation and the generation to come. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's it. That's it. That's it, brother.\"}\n"
