God greatly desires a godly home for us. These are words of restoration and instruction in righteousness from family to ministry. May you be blessed as you listen. Holy, holy Lord, and forever you are God, and forever you are God. Hallelujah, hallelujah. And forever you are God. We thank our God again for another time as we all connect together this evening. We appreciate him for his love, for his mercies, for his grace. We appreciate him for his goodness. We appreciate him again for another time to look at the scriptures, to learn together, to reflect on God. On the matter we have been considering, love, the solid foundation for holiness. We have been considering this matter for some time now. And we are just going to press the matter further from where we left it last week. Last week we began to look at the apostolic prayer. The apostolic prayer and the apostolic, the apostolic prayer and the purpose of the apostolic commandment. Those are the two things we looked at last week. The apostolic prayer. We look at an apostolic and then we also look at a purpose of the apostolic command. And in looking at the matter, we saw that the purpose of the commandment is love out of a pure heart. Love out of a pure heart. That's the purpose of the apostolic commandment. And then when we went to the apostolic prayer, we began to see the place of love as we look at the prayer that Apostle Paul offered to God. On behalf of the church. So, today we want to continue from that place where we left the matter last week. Let us have a word of prayer. Everlasting Father, we are grateful unto you. We thank you, our Lord, for the privilege of gathering together again unto you this evening. Our Father, we pray that as we look into scriptures together, Lord our God, you will speak to our hearts. Lord, we pray for we who are here physically, our brethren who are joining us on telegram, our brethren who are joining us on missal. Lord, we pray that as we all fellowship together this evening, your word will come to us. Lord, you will meet us where we need you most. In the name of Jesus Christ. Lord God Almighty, we pray for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. And by the power of the Holy Spirit, there will be seed for the sower. There will also be bread for the heifers. In the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, inner Father. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. So, we go to Colossians chapter 3. In Colossians chapter 1. Colossians chapter 1. The book of Colossians chapter 1. We are looking at the prayer of Apostle Paul for the church. Now, he says, for this reason, since we also, since the day we heard, we do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom, and while attending. That, oh sorry, the prayer we are looking at is that in Philippians, Philippians, the apostolic prayer in the book of Philippians chapter 1. In the same chapter 1, we take it from verse 9. The same verse 9. And I pray that your love may abound still more and more. In knowledge and in all desirement. I pray that your love may abound still more and more in all knowledge and desirement. That you may approve the things that are excellent. That you may be sincere without offense to the day of Christ. Be filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus to the glory and praise of God. So, we are using the Amplified translation to look at this prayer. We have looked at verse, we are into verse 10. But we are at verse 10. Using the Amplified translation. It said, And I pray that your love may abound yet more and more, and extend to a fullest development in knowledge and all keen insight. That your love may display itself in greater depth of acquaintance and more comprehensive discernment, so that you may surely learn to sense what is vital, and approve and prize what is excellent and of real value. Recognizing the highest and the best, and distinguishing the moral difference, and that you may be untainted, and pure, and unerring, and blameless, so that with sincere heart, you may approach the day of Christ, not stumbling, nor causing others to stumble. Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God. So, we have looked at the fact that, if you look at this prayer, the concern of the Holy Spirit in this prayer, is to make us see that indeed, love grows. And what grows in love is knowledge. What grows in love is understanding. What grows in love is discernment. When love begins to grow in all the knowledge, in all the understanding, in all the discernment, the impact of that growth is that you'll be able to sense what is vital. And we were using the illustration of Jonah last week, that was when we stopped last week, to approve, you know, to sense what is vital. Now, we saw that because Jonah, Jonah is our, is our, is our case study for this test that we are studying. Jonah was so obsessed with what his enemies, that's the Nineveh, people of Nineveh, what they did. He was, he so much focused on it. It became what got his attention. And because of that, what was vital at that critical moment in his life, when God said, Jonah, arise, go to Nineveh. What was vital at that point, was that the Lord was giving a command. An instruction to go and do something. That was the real issue at that time. But you see, what was vital was not vital Jonah. So, you see that because his love was not going, instead of seeing that the Lord is calling him to an assignment that he must go and fulfill, instead of seeing that no, these people must not seek repentance, they must die with God. The judgment of God must fall on them. And I know that if I go and preach, these people may repent. And they repent. The judgment of God comes. But people are so wicked. They must see the judgment of God. So, the best thing right now, is to hear the gospel. You see, what happened to Jonah? He could not perceive what was vital. And what we began to see is that see, Jonah was not a small boy as a prophet. But because he was not, his love was not growing. In understanding the knowledge, you can see how he was missing what is vital. It is the same with us today. If we don't grow, if our love, because one thing you must understand is that the love of God has been brought in our hearts. There is nothing that God could move. No. The truth is that as you grow in grace, as you grow, it is the same way you grow in love. But you see, what grows, what grows in love, what grows in love, is not as if the love itself will grow. When we say love is growing, what we actually mean is that the love that has been shed abroad in your heart, eh, love, eh, you begin to understand the depth of that love. So you begin to ask, you know, that love begins to grow in knowledge. It begins to grow in the life, in the image, in the character of Jesus. So, love grows in knowledge. It grows in understanding. It grows in discernment. As this thing grows, what happens is that the life in which it is growing, that life in which the love is growing, that life will begin to do will begin to save every situation what is vital. Huh? Now, not only will you be able to see what is vital, eh, it sets... You see the next thing is that you will be able to approve and praise what is excellent and of real value. Now, we should be using Jonah because Jonah is our case study. What is of real value? for Jonah, huh? When God When God brought his head down to the center of his head, to the bar of his head, not the forehead, the bar of his head, somewhere at the middle point, and the sun was almost killing Jonah. And then God now caused a small dance to grow. When it grew, what happened? The plant sheathed Jonah from the east of the sun. So Jonah was happy. Ah, thank God for this plant. It didn't mean that God was trying to teach him something. God wanted him to be able to know what is of real value. God now caused a worm to attack the plant. When the worm attacked the plant, the plant died. And because the plant was dying, the sun was not able to beat. And God said, I'm angry because you made this plant to die. And God said, you're not supposed to be angry. He said, yes, I have every reason to be angry, even unto death. That was brother Jonah. Now, that's what God now told him. God said, so, you don't want this plant to die. A plant that you see today, and tomorrow you will not see. You want the plant to die. Eh? You do not want the plant to, you don't want it to die. But you want the people of Nineveh to perish. Eh? A population that is of 120,000. That number, you want them to die. You cannot see any value in those ones. But you are seeing real value in plants. You know what God was trying to tell Jonah? Eh? You see, it's a major problem with us today. Eh? We know that many of us, eh? We think our convenience and our comfort, they are more important than the soul. We think our convenience and our comfort. Eh? They are of real value. Eh? Than, you know, being of edification to somebody's life. Standing to make sure somebody knows God better. Even if it has to cost you so much. Eh? We need to make sure that a brother don't miss it. A sister don't miss it. We need to be sure that, ah, no, this soul don't perish. Many of us with convenience. More than, eh? Prizing the life of man, the souls of man, the edification of the body of Christ. And what mistake we normally make, that we don't see very clearly. Eh? Talking about the body of Christ. Jonah could not see the value of God, the value God was placing on the people. God was seeing a people that should not perish. God was seeing a people that took their life for might, that should not perish. Jonah was seeing enemies that should die. Enemies that should be destroyed. Enemies that should be wasted by God. Why? Because he was self-driven. He was not love driven. He was not purpose driven. He was driven. His love is love. Eh? He does not understand. Eh? The matter of, for God so loved the world. He does not see how much. God knows the death of the wicked. And the wicked should repent. He does not see how much value God placed. Please. I want you to see something. That God placed evil on the soul of the wicked. The Bible says there is joy in heaven. Over what? Over what? One sinner. That does not. That repents. We say to that, for God, what is of real value? Do you notice that? Eh? That word, there is joy in heaven. Eh? It's a very serious thing. Eh? That words people repents in beautiful, great joy. Angels are rejoicing. Wow! No. That tells you the kind of value that God placed on the man. I want to show you two things. Look at the value God placed on the man. What type of man? What type of man? Sinners. People you call wicked people. Am I right? People you call, you know, callous people. Eh? People you rep corners. God kill them. God kill them. God destroy them. Look at how much value God gives them. And to whether contrary to the New Testament. What does the Bible say? The Bible says for God commended his love toward us. In that while we were yet sinners, we were also sinners. We were just sinners. When you were just sinners, we were sinners. When God turned you into sinners, it was not because of our sin, but because of God, because we were sinners. Let's look at the Bible. It says, God is the main God. He is God and God is holy. See why? while we were yet sinners Christ died for us how can we die for enemy but if we hate enemies of God he died for us but my friends, we should not insult you on our capacity, on the evil that we do, on David, on Satan, Satan, stuff like that why? it's because we they belong to us we are weak we care but our value is so much value to a fountain of rivers what is real value? but you know where I'm going you know where I'm going today Where I'm going is not even that Where I'm going is more serious than that And what can I believe How can we turn one back to that picture That we read 1 Peter 4.7 1 Peter 4.7 Let's look at that 1 Peter We'll go to this prayer That 1 Peter 4.7 That we read 1 Peter Chapter 4.7 1 Peter 4.7 4.7 That we read We have read that scripture That place before 4.7 and 8 Where the Bible says That the end of all things We were looking at how to prepare for the end I believe you still remember That was two weeks ago But the end of all things is at hand Therefore Be serious And watchful in your prayers Eh Then Verse 8 We said The Bible says And above all things I've what I've fathered love For one another Love will cover a multitude of sin Immediately after that place Eh The verse 9 He says Be hospitable to one another without grumbling Be hospitable to one another without grumbling Now what we take grumbling away You know it's in the verse 8 I'll fathom love for one another That love will cover what? Multitude of sin Eh So Be hospitable to one another without grumbling Eh And look at the verse 10 Eh As each one has received a gift Minister it to another As a good steward Eh Of the manifold grace of God If anyone speak I want to bring something out for you About this matter of Approving revalue I want to show you I'm showing you how God And the matter of Jonah I've showed you that Look That principle of God has not changed Because in saving us God did not consider whether we are fornicators We are wizards We are wicked Christ came to die for us He died for his enemies God was not preoccupied with what we did against him He was preoccupied with without our soul Eh We come to salvation Eh That's his preoccupation That is the example he wants us to follow Eh Now Now , when you look at this place It's as if anyone speaks Let him speak as an oracle of God If anyone minister Let him minister Let him do it As we damage God's supply God may be glorified through Jesus Christ To whom belong the glory and dominion forever and ever Amen Now, what am I bringing as I make you see this? Huh? Wherever you are listening to me now Wherever you are listening to me now Wherever you are listening to me this evening I want you to hear me And I want you to hear me well Eh Because What we are not realizing Eh Is that Just the way Jonah Eh Became an offender Because he was preoccupied With the offenses of his own offender And he fell out of grace with God If he said As we prepare towards the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ Eh As we are preparing for his coming Let us get something very clear Eh Reason why your love may grow Why your love should grow Is knowledge and understanding I'm telling you The actual bottom line about it Eh As much as it is about The souls of men Eh It is also about your own soul too Your own soul So that your own soul Don't miss out of the grace of God If not for God Jonah was lost If not for God Jonah Was a goner And what made a goner Was what he was preoccupied with You see You felt somebody missed out with God And did you evil And because you were wrongly mistaken with God And because you were wrongly mistaken with God And because you were wrongly mistaken with God You couldn't approve You couldn't get You couldn't You couldn't You couldn't You know Realize what is of real value You were valuing what was done to you And unfortunately You missed the real thing Why am I saying this Is that You will notice that When the bible says Above all things Put on Heaven's love for one another The bible was speaking Within the community Of God christians you know there are two things about doing good the bible says do good to all men we have said that in that of now and in heaven all men wicked men evil men make sure that you don't get preoccupied with your wickedness against you the real value is how their soul will get salvation will you remember also says that especially those are the happened of faith they are not in the same class with delicate people so the value of those people their own value the value of the wicked there's nothing about this about why you must put on saving introducing because my focus is about to to Today, our brother, brotherly relationship, that of Jonah is showing us relationship is wicked. What I'm talking about relationship to us believers is a put on family charity. Huh? Love, commerce, these are same. Huh? We are sending one another without grumbling. Every man has a gift, sister, a few, whatever, just give to each other. Minister, minister. Now, he has said put on family charity. Because if he does it on, eh, offences that are within. See, offences that are without. God is saying that the soul of wicked, they are more important to him than how they have offended you. That of what God showed us in Jonah. Now, when you now come to the believers that are not just wicked. The believers that they are not just wicked. But they are the, the body of Christ. Get preoccupied with what brother? What is that did? How he did, he did? He not do it then. Because don't forget, everybody is say work in progress. There is no perfect brother or perfect sister anyway. God is perfecting. So whatever God is, God is perfecting the things. Within all the things the whole soul is not holding to. That is not making you. You need to work towards the body of believers. Is it? I am bringing. believers you can see how foolish and stupid that kind of reason is because when you confront your believers eh the Lord knows that even you yourself offend people you have not been perfected that's why he said look you are speakable without grumbling you are not able to do that eh if you don't do what do not have what have been shot to the floor the time has come for you to see on the lapses of the brethren on the lapses of brethren and so Jonah eh offense not more like that of Jonah your offense is now more grievous than that of Jonah your offense becomes more grievous in the sense that see look at the book of Luke the book of Matthew Matthew yes and Luke the bible says oh Jesus when he was to die what did Jesus do at the point you have to look very closely at that scripture the bible says Jesus gave up oh let's look at that scripture i think we should see some saving name on this matter of approving what is of real value may the Lord on our hearts may the Lord help our heart may we grow in love this love eh he says love that surpasses knowledge eh hallelujah hallelujah look at something in Luke Luke when Jesus was um for the king that is Luke 22 chapter 22 that is uh the crucifixion there was something there look of Luke they are going towards where um on the cross and Jesus was there was to the other instead um from Luke 22 into 23 um now i mean sorry i'm in 23 already i want to go to the exact place not from thekokkola of the persecution but at the point of the date everything about his death already on 22 at the point of his death now uh look at around the verse yes let's take it from around the verse 42 then he said to jesus lord remember me when you come into your kingdom and jesus said to him assuredly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise look what jesus was speaking to i hope you see how all that he did against god was forgotten in a moment that is with the wicked i'm showing you this matter again in the person of our lord jesus this matter of not focusing on grief but because the matter of re we don't know what is of real value and that is why many times we miss out the real things in our relationship with people now he said today with me in paradise then look at follows now it was about the sixth hour and the darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour then the sun was dark and the temple turned into two and when jesus when jesus had cried out with a loud voice he said what did he say father in your hands i do what i commit with avu said this hey is last if you if you if you look at that what we just read now if you if you look at it in the kjv bible uh the old old uh kim james bible uh you will see that the bible says the bible says um uh the old i want to see if i can go to the old kjv he says in this last look at jv because jv says he gave up the ghost that is last he gave up ghosts but don't give us what is just coming to the hands of the father his spirit is it so when he did that what will be remaining on the cross what will remain on the cross the body am i correct am i correct what's this what's happening on the cross huh now look at something i'm just saying you see something about approving what is excellent when the century saw what had happened glorified god see this was the righteous man and the whole crowd who came together to that side seeing what on their breath and return eh look at what the bible says may we not be like this we don't be like this i'm speaking probably not in context but i want to draw matter out of this matter but not within the context of the world but drawing um a revelation inside that i go in this place you know he said but all i need was who oh can you check your bible my own bible says oh is uh he said is he friends knew him huh what happened he said and the women who followed him from galilee what did they do they stood at a distance washing these things they stood at a distance now there was a man named joseph a council member a good man and a just man he had not consented to their decision and this he was from aramathea a city of the jews who was doing what was doing what was also waiting for the king but a disciple of what a misla a disciple on telegram a disciple on facebook he was not the one that was dead but he was also waiting the bible says this man went to pilate and it was demanded for the body then it is down in a line ladies in a song that was is out of the rock where no one had ever laid before look at your mission when jesus gave up the ghost he left a body that was meant to be prepared for barrier that was meant to be buried that was meant to be prepared for the resurrection i'm talking about jesus i left a body the body of christ that is meant to be prepared for his coming for the resurrection that will come when jesus has played in the sky i will be gathering together to him jesus did not give the body up he left a body or was persecuting that body so jesus appeared and said look what are you doing why are you asking this to me i will deal with you he left a body to be prepared for resurrection you know what his acquiescence is they stood afar pastors are standing afar so-called teachers brothers they are standing afar from this body why it is full of bloods it is things if they go they don't know what the pharisees do they don't know what others will do they will consider a lot of things they don't want to be named they don't want to be framed and so many things we are considering today ah my convenience my comfort i don't like somebody to speak to me like this i don't like to feel like being putting me on the spot for he is going to Maori as they have help anybody to touch my chain i don't like so many things those who knew him were considered but there was a man that was correct i keep telling you in every generation correct men are always few in every generation those who will get it right they are always few the man went to face the principalities in the land he didn't mind the stain that is you know how that body was battered look all those things you see in calendar that they put one fine thing on the cross these people they are confused they don't they don't know what the bible says if you see jesus isaiah described better for us and when we shall see him there is no beauty to desire him you know you see is is his eyes was no more like that of a man do you know what i mean to give money that's good that you are giving me it was tear in his king he's a voice passion for christ that man tried to do something close to what it was as a god the chair as they go the chair as they go they i think times like that wiping an sharing what and that that man denied he didn't stay in the mind the body mind everything he meant what everybody will be saying ah that man a grave that he has prepared for his own self he was not even thinking but me too i may soon die my children will now start again to be looking for where to bury me you can see a man for his interests you will not approve things out of riverland would have been no nonsense there'll be no doing what everyone will just look at you hey and everyone will say ah your case is unfortunate your voice is an unfortunate one understanding is an unfortunate one your case is very very unfortunate you will see heaven telling you that you see heaven pointing that you see the way huh you know what they did they told me uh okay Don't you know that that is exactly what Jesus is doing with us? Even if we are not perfect, everything is perfecting us. He's focusing on how we can meet Him. He said, Father, Father, forgive them, they don't know what they do. And today, He said, give to me. The Bible says, it's everlasting. The Bible says, when we sin, what do we do? We have God. And how God cares for us? With the Father. Give to me. What do I do? Baba, Baba, you know I died for this world. Even when I'm showing you what Jesus is really focusing on. What He's trying to do, to make sure that at the end of the day, none, none. He said, all that the Father has given me, the will of the Father is that I use none. None of them. None of them. This is the will of the Father. Of all that they have given, I should raise them. Then, on the last day, He left everything to be prepared. The reason why He gave gifts unto men. He gave gifts unto men. He followed for the perfect decision. He wanted that everything to be prepared. And Corinthians chapter 4 verse 11. But the one that made hope on high. He left captivity, and He did what? He gave gifts unto men. One, He made a stone. Another one, perfect. Another one, evangelist. Another one, pastor. Another one, teacher. For what? For the perfecting of faith. He did the work of the ministry. For what? For the edification of the body of Christ. He was to welcome with us the unity of the faith. Unto what? Unto the knowledge of the Son of God. Unto what? Unto what? A past man. Unto what? Unto the pleasure of the fullness of the status of truth of Christ. He did the first focusing on the gift today. As the reaching to value. And perfecting the body. You know what believers are focusing on today? What she did against me. What I don't like about her. What this woman is. That's what push me. If I go out. That is why I said. May you not be men. Who are looking at the body from afar. It's her queen tansies. So unfortunate. Their tansies. The people you thought we know. We say. Ah. Say the soldiers. Are they gone? Hey. Oh yes. Let's go. Carry. They were the ones that were washing afar. It was a brother you failed that was not correct. And that is why I teach ten people. That will be your privacy level. The people you think don't count. You will see they are wrong. They are wrong. They are wrong. They are wrong. They are wrong. They are wrong. You will see. You will see them counting. The people you are thinking should count. They may not count. Why? It is this matter of whether we are walking in love. Or whether you are occupied with self. That is why you see the apostle praying for the church. He said. I pray that your love will grow. That your love can grow. In what. In understanding. In knowledge. So that, number one, you'll be able to sense the things that are vital. Number two, you'll be able to approve what is of real value. May the things you force on your life, put in value on. May there not be things that does not matter to heaven. In the name of Jesus. What are you focusing on today? The purpose of the charity. Prepare this body. What I'm telling you is that heaven rejoices over soul. Heaven rejoices. The focus of heaven is that can you help us perfect? The body we know is not yet perfect. Can you help me? I gave you gifts of perfect things. You are busy hitting your head against the wall. That imperfect body is wronging you. Do you expect that? The perfect body is not the wrong gift before. The fellowships, the advising, division, evil speaking. You just see people, you just do, you say, some are no good Christians. Some are not serious. What I'm about to make you say is that even the wicked, that's become the point of the wicked. Even the wicked. What God is thinking about the wicked is not for the wicked to die in the assailant. If that works, that you may lay aside what the wicked did against you and how the soul of the wicked can recover. And how the soul of the wicked can recover. That was the lesson we learnt in Jonah. That was what we learnt in the 3rd. That said, Excuse me. Forget all that is against you. Whatever has been written against you, I abolish it. To be a good lamb, you want to judge. I pass everything. You will be in paradise. Let all that I want be there. But you see, see he did it. He killed my daughter. He did that. He was the one that killed not that person. He was the one that did that. What matters more? Was that a mountain? Somebody will be wicked. What do you know? That I've been convicted by the life of Jesus. Jesus, the other one said. Even you, she said you will serve the righteous man. Why could did you save us? Why could you do something about it? But who I was convicted by the life, there was one putting his faith in Jesus. They said Lord Jesus, remember me. And it was not oh. This is when I simplify you. When you were busy stealing around. And were busy killing people. You did not tell me to remember you. now that there is no more remedy that they want to kill you before your death you are like a stupid man that was Jesus we will grow in the world this love it is something you know what Paul said I will show you now that in another meeting Paul said that we may comprehend the length, the breadth the height and the depth of the comprehensible love of God now show what the Bible says the length, the breadth the length of the love that we cannot comprehend how do you understand that why it is so amazing I see if we don't get in this kind of love if we don't grow in this dimension don't grow in this dimension there are so many implications I would not be able to approve Christ's scripture literally I want to conclude that Philippians chapter 1 that prayer today if you look at that that prayer that we read that chapter 1 chapter 1 you see don't grow in this kind of love look at the Bible that you may surely learn to sense the Bible and approve and praise what the excellent recognizing the highest and the best it is not bad it is not bad it is not bad there is there is best don't be sad if you grow in love you will be prized by the best what is best it is it is and that you may be untinged and pure and unerring and blameless that's the one that's very important again apart from the first one you see the problem is that don't get into the first one eh you cannot get into the second one One cannot approve what is the best in sessions. You cannot abstain. On thing that means, can I take a simpler translation of that on thing? Can I get a simpler translation? Let me see if I can read NLT from here. He said, NLT, what you don't want really matters. So that you may live pure and blameless. You see, what you don't know really matters. You don't know what really matters. At the end of the day, you will not be able to live a pure and blameless life. You will have things which everyone will blame. Is that what happened to Jonah? Now what happened to Jonah? Now what happened to Jonah? Look at what he does for him in Matthew 12. He said, On that day, I will separate the goat from the sheep. And I will say to this goat, Be back from me to everlasting destruction. Prepare for the devil and his angels. I was hungry, you didn't give me to eat. I was this, you didn't this. I was that and that. And I will say when? I will say when you did the least of the brethren. Then after one. Welcome! For when I was hungry, you did this, you did that. You did this, you did that. Do you know that on account of certain things that people have done, some brethren have decided to punish them and not do some things. Mind you, God already warned us that even when your enemy is hungry, give him to eat. Now this guy is not your enemy, but a brethren who was not perfect, he didn't do some things well. And you set up something to deny him and to punish him for it. You are that evil ass towards certain people. I'm not talking about discipline. You see, I'm talking about motive and intention. I'm talking about being revengeful. That is why, if you look at that, I like it in Isaiah 35. It says so that you may know the moral difference. The moral difference. Certain things they are similar, but they are not the same. They look like the same, but they are not the same. Do you know why they are not the same? It's the motive. You see, God search the heart. And he understands the motive of the thoughts. God understands the down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down thing. Why certain things are done by certain people. To make you see. See that it was always like this. How was that? This thing simply be a fallash of words. Of collation. That's one. It is not a friendship. Eh? Missed priority. That's the good Samaritan. It is. It is. Leave that. You see. Maybe they were rushing to church. Ah! I'm a priest. I should not be stoned. Right. No, no, no, no, no. I should not have anything to, to touch. I know. But a Samaritan came. And he took the man. And he bound him. And he did everything. And Jesus said go and do likewise. Maybe the priest just felt that. Ah! Holy garment. That's why he directly used people that he will classify as religious. Morally upright and good. How they can err. When you don't learn to approve what is excellent. When in situations you cannot, you cannot see what is best. But when we grow in love When love grows in discernment When love begins to grow in understanding You are able to discern You are able to know this one is like this This one is like this You will not just conclude everything There is this habit among the Yorubas I don't know best how to say it But what that means is that People say we will cover our eyes For bad people to go away Even when good people will pass You will not know So you better open your eyes And pray God for discernment To discern So that the one that you need to do What he offers you You will not miss to do it The Bible says there is no believer That is why you saw it Above all to put on charity As we have the coming of the Lord This place Look If you will not err If you will be pure and blameless Till Jesus returns If you will not err If you are thinking of becoming holy Because you are looking at love The solid foundation of holiness If you are thinking of a holy life Be praying that your love Will grow in knowledge Be praying that it will grow In understanding Be praying that it will grow in discernment Because if these things don't grow There is no way you can live Pure and blameless life It's not possible Because It is in God That we know That there is a difference Between living And existing It is in God It is in God that we know it But we don't know God wants us to live God doesn't just want us to exist He wants us to live God is love The life of God Is a life of love For God so loved It was love that brought redemption It was love that brought justification It was love that brought sanctification It was love that brought Every other thing you are looking at in God Every other thing you are looking at in God What made God able to discern Understand And made a plan That it was the only day That died for him It was because of love It was that that made God To value what is excess These are my image And they are my likeness I will redeem my image I will redeem my life Every other thing may not be redeemed But not my image Not my likeness Angels that have sinned Redemption Animals The earth Is cursed I will wipe away the earth I will make a new heaven I will make a new earth The devil No redemption All those who know redemption But not He says A man indeed ought not to cover his head Because his worth Is the image And the glory of God Every other thing may not be redeemed But know My image, my glory And love Brought a propelling Everything is inside God The Bible says that it's not for any good work That we did Because there was nothing good in us What people say Because I am That's why God saved me You don't understand the gospel There is no good in anybody Because Because he is good That is why God now foreordained him The good work that you did Is after you were made to come to God God did not take anybody because of him Nobody merits the mercy of God Maybe we need a daughter You know Our family we need to be That is why God There is nothing like that Nobody God did what he did That was his office All real He saved us Not counting our trespasses And he saved us And he saved us We will grow this way We will not be able to live the life of God We will keep erring We will keep falling We will have blames He who doesn't walk in love Walk in darkness It has blinded him He will be doing wrong He will be thinking he is doing right Love The solid foundation for holiness Let's talk to God this evening Let's talk to God this evening Love My major charge to you this evening The emphasis of this evening message Is beyond last week We were looking at Jonah As our case study This week our focus is See Jesus left a body To be prepared for burial It is made Who can grow in love And that can prepare this body Or else You will stand afar Even though you know Jesus You will stand afar You will not prepare this body You will not prepare this body It is our emphasis today If you don't grow in love You will err You will not be You will have blame You will have blame Different blames here and there How How The things you think you value Will not be valued As far as God is concerned Huh The things you think you are holding Pastors are not sinners Believers are not wicked people They may do wrong But Even the wicked They may do wrong But Even the wicked They may do wrong But Even the wicked They may do wrong But Even the wicked They may do wrong But Even the wicked They can be evil When you're easy trashed But Even you are You are You are Men Men Men Men us. Thank you for not hiding yourself from us. Lord, commit our hearts, commit our lives. Lord, you help us to live thereby, to live according to that you have spoken to us in the Jesus. Oh, Lord, no man is willing to walk with you. God is saying, you are the Lord that walk in us, but to will and to do of you a good pleasure. This is nothing but your pleasure. Oh, Lord, walk it in us, walk it through us, that we may also be among those that will prepare your body in the name of Jesus. Help us to give up our trust. Help God again for us, because you first gave up yourself. Help us in the name of Jesus. Strengthen our heart as you were strengthened in the name of the Lord. As you were strengthened even when the enemy came. You were not left alone at any time. Lord, as we call upon you, we are willing, we are ready. We only ask only Spirit through the work of God in us and through us, that our Father may be glorified. That our God, our Lord, will be pleased. That we may bring to you a splendor that will be showcasing your glory. Please manage our hearts. Please undo our hearts. Please help our hearts. Please work upon our hearts. Father, please circumcise our hearts. We know that we are wounded in the name of Jesus. Thank you, faithful God. Thank you for your son. We pray we will not leave less of this that you have revealed through him. O Lord, he will be to us. That as you appear in the Lord, he will receive, O Lord, a welcome in the name of Jesus. Thank you, faithful God. We trust in you, O Lord, that you will continue with us beyond this point. Unto Christ and your life and his life is fully formed in us. In Jesus' unfailing name, we pray.

Lord, grant us light and direction. We will not walk in darkness. And Lord, we are praying over and over and over again. So many things are happening in our immediate local environment. So many things are happening across the state. So many things are happening across the nation. So many things are happening across West Africa, across Africa, and across the globe. Lord, everything pointing towards the fulfillment of that which you have spoken. Lord, our God, everything pointing towards the fulfillment of that which you have spoken. Lord, our God, everything rushing slowly, slowly, towards the end that you have determined. Our God, our Father, we are saying in the midst of all of this, let your mercy avail for us. We shall be vessels of mercy. We will enjoy mercy abundantly. In the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Eternal Father. Amen. Amen. Amen. Since the month of June, we have been looking at the subject matter of trying to a lot of things around it, trying to learn, trying to see what the Bible says. And for about a week now, we have been looking at Luke 9, 23. Let him take up his cross. Let him deny that he has taken up his cross, and follow me. We have been able to exhaust, let him, we are looking at, let him take up his cross. We have been able to in trying to define, explain what, and we are going to last week, look at what does it mean, or how do we take the cross? How do we take it? That was our focus last week. And I did mention last week that we'll be looking at some fundamental implication of the death of Jesus on the cross. You know, the implication, what the implication is for us, you know, this week. However, we will not go that direction this evening. We will not go that direction this evening. I trust the Lord that we will go that direction maybe next week, maybe upper week. I don't know. But the direction I want us to go this evening is the direction of a burden that the Lord has been burdening my heart with in the last three, four days. I shared this partly in my church yesterday, the church I attend. I shared it partly. But I discovered that it's a burden that the Lord seems to be asking me to share much more the more. The more I wanted to live it, this morning again, the burden was still coming. And I don't know, it might be something that may cut across all our three programs. Today's discipleship class, Saturday singles club, and then upper Saturday, first Saturday singles club, and second Saturday marriage forum. We may be sharing this burden. Maybe in different dimensions. How it applies to the single, particularly, then maybe to the married, and all of that. But today we want to, we want to look at it, how it applies to us, generally as believers. How it applies generally as believers. And honestly, when the technical were asking me, how best do we tag this burden, I was just wondering how best I could tag the burden. But what I told them to tag, what I told them to take as a topic, is when the Lord decides not to answer. When the Lord, decides not to answer. You know, that's why I told them to tag it. Just looking for how best I can tag the burden. And it is not about this, primarily about waiting for God's answer. No, it's not in that direction. As we go on, the direction will be clearer. I was studying the book of 1 Samuel chapter 28. Chapter 28. Please let's turn to that scripture. When the Lord decides not to answer. It's a very familiar story. Very, very familiar story. When you don't want to burden your heart with something familiar, you need to burden it around the things, that are happening around us, that are about to happen. Now, in 1 Samuel chapter 28. In 1 Samuel chapter 28. The Bible says, let me take it from verse 1. It says, now it happened in the days that the Philistines gathered their arms together for war, to fight with Israel. And, as he said to David, you assuredly know that, you will go with me to battle. You and your men. So, David told Ashi, that surely, you know what your servant can do. And Ashi said to David, therefore, I will make you one of my chief guardians forever. Now, while the Philistines were preparing for the battle, to fight against Israel, the Bible gave us another interlude in verse 3. It says, Now, Samuel hath died. As at this time, Samuel hath died. Samuel hath died. And all Israel hath lamented for him, and buried him in Ramah, in his own city. And also, as at this time, Saul, the king, hath put the mediums and the spirities out of the land. So, the Bible came back to what it started in the verse 1. Then the Philistines gathered together, and came and encamped at Shemen. So, Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped at Gilboa. When Saul saw the armies of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. He was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. When Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord did not answer him. When the Lord decides not to answer. When Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord did not answer him. Either by dreams, or by hearing, or by prophets. If you look at that in the Amplified translation, to explain that hearing, what it is. When Saul inquired of the Lord, it is to answer him. Either by dreams, or by hearing. The hearing then in brackets is symbol worn by the priests when seeking the will of God for Israel. God did not answer Saul through that. Or by the prophets. So, the three Saul could get an answer he did not by dream there was no answer he used the song by the priest for an answer there was no answer then the other thing was through the prophet he knew that they would call on the prophet the prophet now say God save the Lord whatever nothing came from the prophet and that is why we are picking our word of fellowship from this evening when the Lord decides not to answer I said something here may may the Lord answer us in the day of trouble may the Lord answer us in the day of trouble now very particularly is when the Lord decides not to answer particularly adding to what the topic is is when the Lord decides not to answer in the day of trouble when the Lord decides not to answer in the day now you see the matter of answer in the day of trouble is so crucial is really crucial now if you look at if you look at Psalm Psalm Psalm 91 look at Psalm 91 let's look at something else look at something in Psalm 91 look at something in Psalm 91 when the Lord decides not to answer in the day of trouble when the Lord decides not to answer in the day of trouble look at Psalm 91 Psalm 91 he says I want to go to I want to take it from I want to take it from verse 14 look at it from verse 14 he says because he has set his love upon me therefore I will deliver him I will set him on I because he has known my name he shall call upon me and I will do what I will answer him what's the next thing I will be with him when in trouble and what will he do I will deliver him and I will honor him with long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation so you notice that the righteous eh ordinarily have the right to live they have the right to live they have their day of trouble the name of the Lord Proverbs 18 tell is a strong tour the righteous do what they run into it and they are saved so there is something about a day to run into the Lord there is something about a day of calling upon God because because there is trouble there is always this aspect to our life eh but what we are looking at is when the Lord decides not to answer in the day notice that when Saul saw the battle the Bible says what he was afraid he needed what an answer he needed an answer and that day when he needed an answer what did the Lord do the Lord decided not to answer so we are looking at when the Lord decides not to answer and brethren I want to tell us this as I was meditating on the verse now I want to give you a ground I want to begin with trying to go into the burden gradually you see what is serious there are many consequences for disobedience you are understanding me there are many consequences for disobedience but one serious consequence of disobedience that our hearts should tremble about is when the Lord refuse to answer us in the day of our trouble one serious consequence of disobedience that our hearts you see you may be doing certain things you may be doing it and it looks like you are prospering it looks like you are doing well you know you are not obeying the Lord you know and it looks like there is no consequence it looks like you know there are diverse ways God responds to disobedience when one of them that we should tremble about is when the Lord chooses that I will wait till the day of your trouble I will wait you can be doing it may looks as if you are having your way in your disobedience it may looks as if you are doing it wrong and yet if God is not with me why will I be prospering and if God is really angry with what I am doing He should not be blessing me sometimes the way God responds to disobedience eh? eh? is to wait for the day of your trouble it was this dimension that the Lord began to point my heart to in the last 3-4 days in the last 3-4 days it was flowing scriptures joining scriptures as I was looking at it eh? I want you to understand it over and against this background Matthew chapter 24 Matthew chapter 24 understand this discussion over and against this background in Matthew 24 in Matthew 24 from verse 8 sorry verse 3 now as the Lord Jesus sat on the mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately saying tell us where will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age and Jesus answered and said take heed that no one deceives you now please brethren you know one thing about this the coming of the Lord eh? is that you may be deceiving people and the Lord will allow will allow you to prosper see take heed that you are the Lord will not stop deceivers you may be deceiving people you may be misleading people and it looks like your ministry is prospering what you are doing you are going on although the Lord said take heed that you are not deceived but he tells you that deceivers will prosper one thing about the end one thing I want you to guide against is that this will be a period where you may not be honest and yet you will be prospering you may not be truthful and yet you are prospering and then you will say eh? you may not be truthful you may not be truthful you may not be truthful you may not be truthful eh? how do you put this in English now? you should you should you should eat while you are working but eh? eh? but eh? we are not talking about eh? honest game because if you label eh? and don't make profit then there is a problem with that label it means the label is not blessed you get the point I am making when you label you should profit but I am talking of dishonest game eh? when you explain when you won't begin to explain bribe in the name of ehm you know appreciation you get the point I am making won't begin to touch what I am trying to talk about you know you are taking bribe won't begin to touch what I am trying to talk about you know you are taking bribe but you find a way to make it look righteous and Godly it's actually no we need to fast track the the the project but you know what you are collecting is bribe you note it down I am talking of I'm talking about I'm not talking about sinners I'm not talking about I'm not talking about I'm not talking about sinners I'm not talking about I'm not talking about unbelievers they may call it any kind of name they don't have problem the bland cannot live like this the next stage the next stage the next stage the next stage is to cannot live like the same am i correct am i correct yes so i'm not they have different name of calling them but what i'm addressing is i'm talking to believers the one thing you should know about this period is that you will notice that deceivers you may be dishonest and you may be prospering but your case may just be that the lord decides that he will not answer he's waiting for the day of your trouble he's just waiting for the day of your trouble you notice the way god and the soul he decides he decided that i will not answer in the name of the lord the day of his trouble one thing about this period is being deceitful being dishonest not being transparent not being sincere and yet prospering but be careful when you seem to be prospering like this the lord may just be waiting for the day of your trouble you may just be waiting the day you will not come and say lord and then you will not come and say lord and then you will not come and say lord we call god all the weapons throughout the mediums start to answer they will say that come and pray the prayer of this the of the of the offense will hear the seed it will not be your own case they will talk a breath they will do all kinds of things we know to do in scripture but the lord has just decided not to answer we not just chose not to answer so we're looking at this matter again this background of the period that we are in are you dizziness are you insincere are you water and it looks as you are making gain brethren you need to be with your one serious consequence of disobedience to tremble about is that you may prosper in whatever you may need to reign so what's on the throne god was but he does not understand that there is a time that god is waiting for there is a time that god is waiting for god does wait for what did he do he said you will hear of war verse six we have war and of rumors of war see that you do not know for all these things must come to pass but yes there's against this kingdom against kingdom there will be family there will be personally and earthquake in various places we have been seeing that and that's going on all at the beginning of sorrow they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you and enter the four nations for my name's sake and then Many will be offended. They will hate one another. There are many false prophets who rise and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, what will happen? Eh? That's another dimension. Eh? So much lawlessness. And you can be joined in as a believer. You can be moving on with the lawlessness. That is how it is now. There is no better way to do it. Eh? That is how we are now doing it. Because lawlessness will abound. Eh? I am speaking to those of us who call Saul. I am speaking to those of us that are his disciples. Eh? People can do as they like. But one thing you must be watching. When he looks at him, your love is washing called for righteousness, for godliness, and you are doing whatever you like. You are moving, you are joining the bandwagon and it looks like everything is still okay. Your job is going well. Your marriage is going well. Your ministry is going well. Everything is doing well. But you know that you are not working in obedience. Eh? Eh? Eh? My bad may just be waiting for the day of your trouble. You might have just decided that look, the trouble that I wish you the consequence of your disobedience. How? Because there is a time there will be a of adversity. There will be a time of challenge. There will be a time to come in different ways. But the beauty for the godly is that in his trouble I will be with him. I will deliver him and I will honor him. Eh? It was the reverse of soul. It was the reverse of soul. How exactly does this thing how did they build into one another? How did they build? But then I want us to quickly do a quick comparison or comparison of something of this passage in Proverbs 1 20 to 33. Proverbs chapter 1 verse 20 to 33. Proverbs 20 to 33. Look at how the Lord presents this place. Look at the word of the Lord. It says wisdom calls out aloud. Do you notice that in your Bible? If your version says aloud eh? If your version says aloud which other word is your own version of music? Which other word? That verse 20. Mine says wisdom calls aloud outside. Has anyone done anything of that aloud? It shouts in the city. That's it. The point I'm making is that wisdom was not speaking in a no tone. Wisdom was speaking what? And when do you have cause to shout? One. When you want. When you want everybody to hear. That's true. Two. When it says look at it. It says wisdom calls aloud outside. She raises her voice in the open square. She cries in the open in the chief concourses. At the opening of the gate she speaks her word. Eh? When you have cause to raise your voice what are the possibilities? Number one you want everybody to hear. Number two what are the possibilities we raise our voice? Distress. Eh? Distress. Distress. When you speak aloud yes you can cry out in distress that's true. When we raise our voice when you want to talk and you are talking aloud you can be distressed. Whichever occasion can occasion shouting talking aloud. You want you want when you want to warn sometimes you may have cause to shout. You may have cause to shout when you want to warn. well the world you may have come to shout when the matter is important sometimes you speak in very low and solemn tone sometimes you shout because the matter is serious the matter is important now he says wisdom shout now what is this shouting he says how long you simple ones will you love simplicity i want to show you things in our life that builds to a point where God decides not to answer eh it is not something that just happens suddenly no things in our life builds up to them the first thing why he was shouting eh is that he was shouting because these simple ones the simple youths you hear me eh people who don't care about things careful people how long will you simple ones love simplicity and mockers delight in scornin eh and fool with knowledge now the things that build is that wisdom must have been calling your attention there are matters in your life every day that you have to deal with there are matters in your life every day that you have to deal with there is no point to point at yah you look just carefree about it you know the things is not correct you know it is not the way things are today you know eh you see how long will you love simplicity eh How long will you hate knowledge? You know the truth, you know that the scripture says this thing But somehow you just explain it away with another thing You just move away to, you just explain it away You just explain it away so that you can keep having your way You just take it aside to keep having your way So wisdom was raised with us In a situation where we hate knowledge In a situation where we love our simplicity In a situation where we underrate the spiritual truth It is time to pray God understands You know those kinds of attitudes And somehow the Lord keeps calling your heart So This is not correct You just explain it away You see it is because of my office You know I am so busy You know there is no time You just keep explaining That is what you mean by loving simplicity You just hate knowledge It is not as if you are ignorant But you hated knowledge Look at the next thing It says turn at my rebuke Surely I will pour out my spirit on you And I will make my word known to you Why is wisdom shouting out again He has been rebuking He has been rebuking When the Lord has been rebuking a man on a matter Somehow you fix the warning of the Lord You set it aside I am showing you how matters build How matters build to the point Where the Lord now decides I will wait for the day of your trouble The second thing is When rebuke has been coming on a matter Correction has been coming on a matter And yes you will not heed rebuke You will not heed correction It has come in this to neglect it Look at the next thing It says because I have called I have called and you refuse There have been points of call There have been points of call Different points of call Calling your attention Either by the word of God Either by a preaching Either by a message Either by an exhortation Either by a brother Somebody came to visit Somebody said something In fact a fellowship like this There have been a call It has been coming in different ways Different things have been following your attention But you know what you did You just ignored the call I called and you refused I raised my hand And no one regarded Are you still breathing Are you still breathing Look at the next thing Because they disdain all my counsel and would none of my rebuke. If you look at that in another translation. Since you ignore all my advice, I will not accept my rebuke. Please, where is the advice of God? Where is the advice of God? In his word. In his word. See, all unrighteousness is a sin. You throw it under the carpet. Don't do this. You keep doing. He says, you ignore all my counsel. Look at that case of Saul and the matter here. He says, I also will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your terror comes. So, what is this in the Bible? What is it? What is it, O Saul? Is it right? So, all this why, when wisdom did not react, what was he waiting for? He was waiting for the day when their calamity will come. There are times when wisdom will decide to wait. He says, I also will laugh at your calamity and I will mock when your terror comes. That is, when the day of trouble comes, what happens? What happens? He decides not to answer. He decides not to answer. He says, when your terror comes like, and your destruction comes like a wide wind, when distress and anguish come upon you, then they will call on me, but I will not answer. Then they will call. And I will do what? I will not answer. They will seek me. Look at it. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me. Notice that the people that God decides about are people that are imprivileged, that have been opportuned to receive counsel, to receive rebook, to receive instruction. Are you seeing it? Yes. People, you know, you know, these people, people that in different ways, eh, God gives the opportunity to be instructed, and yet they choose to turn their way. One way that God deals with disobedience, there are several ways that God deals with them. Eh? God can punish you instantly. Is that not true? Is that not true? God can decide. That you don't prosper. Is that not? But we are looking at a special case today. That one terrible way with which God deals with disobedience is for God to wait for the day of trouble. It's a terrible way of God handling a man's disobedience. It's a terrible way. Eh? It's like, let's say, okay, continue. Continue with him next, at the end. Let's say, man, go on. You are doing it, man. No problem at all. No, just move on. You are not interrupted. It looks like you are having your way. It looks like you are doing wrong and you are prospering. You will notice in the Thessalonians, it says, because judgment against the evil walk is not executed speedily. But what we are saying today is that sometimes God may not, you know, may not execute speedily because you are guiltless. Because your heart is in the way. What are we? God is merciful. Eh? God. God. God is gracious. He is gracious. That is true about God. He is a gracious God. Huh? But it is important to know that God can be severe. It is important to know, eh, that God also can be tough. And be tough. God can be very tough. What way of God's toughness, eh, is to allow your prosperity in your disobedience? Only to offer you. To mock at you in the day of your trouble. It's one aspect of God that we must know and be afraid about. God is gracious. God is merciful. God is a God of second chance. God can, you know, that is God. God can have mercy on whom He will have mercy. But I also want you to know. Eh? God can also, God's way can have mercy on whom He will have mercy. The same way. God can also decide not to answer and wait for a man punishing in the day of his trouble. It's the same God. It's the same God. It's the same God who works in all of this. It's the same God who works in all of this. He says, He says, they will see me diligently, they will not find me. Eh? There will be a time when you will now be seeking God. You will now want to seek God. You will now obey Him, but you will now find God. Eh? He said, because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of God. Brethren, that is the matter. Eh? Let us, let us be careful these last days. Let us choose the fear of the Lord. These days, these days that it looks like iniquity is abounding. These days that it looks like. The love of many and one single. It's because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of God. Let us be careful as disciples of the Lord to choose this fear. There are so many options around us today. Many of them looking good, looking okay. Particularly because those who are doing it are prospering in it. But we forgot that the Lord said. That iniquity will abound. You forgot that. That God will actually allow iniquity to prosper. It's not that He is not coming back to punish it. This day that we are in is a day that God is high worth. Eh? The wicked will have their ways. Don't think that for that reason. Eh? God has justified wickedness. Don't think that for that reason. Eh? God will not punish dishonesty. God will not punish disobedience. God will not punish everything that goes against His fear. God will eventually come to punish it. And one thing that God is using to call Him attention to today. Is that one way that God is going to punish it in our days. Is that there will be so many godly people. That God will not answer them in the day of their trouble. There are many. There are many. There are many. There are many godly people that are doing ungodliness. Many of these children are going in with. And what heaven has decided. Is that I will laugh at their crimes. I will laugh. I will mock the people who mock them. They didn't take me safe. Why are you so shouting? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay. You don't know you are supposed to obey that god before. That is what it means to mock. So I was afraid. Normally in Israel. Eh? Go and check. When the king face mighty men. Mighty men of war. Large number. You will see God will appear. And he will say don't be afraid. Eh? Go. I will be with you. You remember Joshua? God told him, don't be afraid of this great multitude For I will deliver them Into your hand Remember David God said, you know Normally what God does to his people in the end of their trouble Is to stand with them Is to stand for them Is to strengthen them Is to give them courage There was so much fear Tell me encouragement Something To bring courage In the face of trouble Don't be surprised When this kind of thing Begins to happen to people And God decides not to answer God decides to mock at their fear What is the What is the key Of this burden This admonition Is that the Lord is calling us That in the midst of all that is happening around us today Please Choose the fear Choose the fear of God Choose the fear of God The fear of God Choose the fear of God It's a clear call of God To his people Particularly God is not calling the sinners God is not calling the ungodly But God is calling his people God is warning his people Choose the fear of God Choose the fear of God Today Scripture is used to justify iniquity Scripture is used to justify Sinfulness We use scriptures To validate A lot of errors We use scriptures to justify A lot of wickedness in the land Some will say As the Lord God said From to Caesar what belongs to Caesar And God belongs to God So what belongs to God And that extension of I don't call people out This call Is a call to God's people It's a call to God's people It's a call to believers That see Brethren Everywhere we find ourselves Let us choose the fear of the Lord He says They will not counsel And vice My every rebuke Let us choose the counsel of God Let us choose the place of scriptures Let us be careful To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To To Why You know You know You know You know Don't Don't Don't let us Don't let us Okay Look at how I put it here We must Ever Underrate The Lord In our life As the first And foremost I take that in We must Never Ever underrate the place of the Lord in our life as the first and the foremost we must never ever underrate his place in our life in our and his kingdom his foremost that is what we are created for what is your duty of man what is your duty of man to fear God and keep his command that is your duty of man that is why you were created to fear God and keep his command it must never be underrated what the Lord is saying is that his people they are underrating him why are they underrating him because of his mercy because of his goodness because of his graciousness but I want to tell you God will eventually answer by not asking the day of why must we not underrate his place in our life why must we not why must we not underrate his place Isaiah chapter 48 verse 17 and 18 why must we not underrate his place in our life why must we not why must we not underrate his place in our life Isaiah Isaiah chapter 48 verse 17 and 18 Isaiah chapter 48 verse 17 and 18 how the Lord is thus in this place it says thus says the Lord and I want you to see the Lord speaking to you very particularly in this scripture very particularly in this scripture far you know you know we what the Lord is now reading the spirit of revelation is the spirit of prophecy the spirit of prophecy is the spirit of scriptures don't ever forget that only men wrote the scripture as the spirit moved them the spirit of prophecy is the spirit of revelation the spirit of revelation is the spirit of scripture so that any revelation any prophecy that violates scripture can be the Holy Spirit essentially this is for Christ the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is also the spirit of truth and you know one thing about it again it's also the spirit of intercession so that why would God be so disobedient it's not to answer in prayers because the spirit of revelation is also the spirit of intercession it says thus says the Lord your redeemer the only one of Israel I am the Lord your God eh look at it it's your redeemer the only one of Israel did you see I am the Lord your God what does that mean I am it and I'm most why must you not underestimate him he says I am the Lord your God who teaches you to profit leads you by the way you should go oh that you have heeded my command my commandment then your peace will have been like a river and your righteousness like the wave of the sea what is the Lord calling our attention to that the reason why we should not underestimate his place is that if the Lord your God is the Lord the person who is your God is the Lord you get that at all the person you are calling your God is also the Lord that is the one to whom nobody should say no is the Lord your God is the Lord any other person is not to go in shock you should obey them and run to God God can overrule whatever they want to do because they are not the Lord they are different type of people they are different type of people they are different type of people they are different type of people they worship but the Lord is telling time to make us see that the one we call God is who the Lord importantly you must know is that He is the only one who does who teaches you the prophet who leads you in the way you should go every time you are ignoring His command you are not walking in His feet in his faith. It may look as if you are bad but the truth is that you did not profit. It may look as if you are not gaining. You are making loss. To gain, it is the Lord who teaches you to profit. The last scripture I want to read is Psalm 78. Psalm 78. Psalm 78. Psalm 78. Psalm 73. Not 78. 73. 73. Truly, God is good to you. God is good to you for Israel and to you for such as are pure in heart. Eh? That as for me, my faith was almost tumbled. My faith had yet for I was earnest of the boastful. I saw the prosperity of the wicked. Be careful. Don't join prosperity of the wicked. God is good to you too. It may seem the poor in heart will not make it. It looks as if they are they ask for me, then we are the boastful. When I saw the prosperity of the wicked, there was no pangs in their but their strength is firm. They were not in trouble as that may. Are they plagued like other men? Therefore, pride served as their necklace. Blood covered them like garment. Their eyes bulged with abundance. Not more than their heart could wish. They scoff and speak wickedly in oppression. They speak love to me. They set their mouth against the heaven. And their tongue walked through the earth. Are you seeing them? Because what they are, they are doing, they are prospering. And you know what the Lord is saying? Because these people are prospering. The love of many churches are worse than good. We are joining them. We are envying them. We are stepping into their shoes. God is actually good to those who are poor in heart. It may not appear so now. But the truth is that God is good to those who are poor in heart. Don't let us join them. They speak against the heavens. And their tongue walks through the earth. Therefore, his people return the air. And water of the cup are drained by them. And they say, how does God know? You see it? And there is no knowledge in the most eye. Religion is just the opium of the people. There is nothing like a world that is there. Even your pastors too, they are just looking for water to eat. There is nothing. You know the way people just caricature really. You know, caricature everything. Make everything look like. Because there is no hell. There is no heaven. There is no rest. On the last day. On the last day. Only true believers will be raptured. On the last day. On the last day. Only true believers will be raptured. On the last day. On the last day. Only true believers will be raptured. On the last day. They seem to prosper. They say, I don't believe. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, it is not that you do not take it easy. You know, you are going to. Eh? It looks like wickedness is for him. Eh? It is a fact of God's love. When he made of the most high. These are the ungodly. Who are always at ease. You see? How are they? They are at ease. I think with godliness, you begin to wonder. What is to remain godly? I was the weakest. And me, that time, I was always at ease. One challenge told, you have to, you know, if you must live godly in this life, you will suffer. You get the point I'm making? You are always at ease. They have made their way. They have to have all the connections. It looks like, wow! Sometimes, last year, two gurus at 2 a.m. Two were killed at 2 a.m. And then the other came because we were in fear, fear. So, gradually, everybody on this line was jumping. They were just jumping, jumping. Gradually, the line here was long before. This one started to get longer. This one started to get longer. And they were jumping. And then, the end of the healing. The Lord was trying to make you see. Because iniquity is prospering, men are changing sides. Men are just changing sides. It looks like, it looks like, it looks like, if you must stand for this, if you must do the truth, if you must do that which is right, you will be stagnant. You will not move. I noticed that ATM was moving. It was moving. Only, only on the long run, were you to know that everything here was fake currency. True currency was actually at this side. The Lord will help us. In the name of Jesus Christ. These are the gods. They increase in riches. Look at what he said. Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence. For all day long, I have been plagued, and chastised every morning. If I said, I will speak thus, behold, I will have been untruthful to the generation of your children. When I thought how to understand this, it was too painful for me. Do you understand what he is trying to say? Do you understand what he is trying to say? He was trying to understand, it was painful because, the people you think should have it well, are not having it well. Because they should not have it well, are having it well. And that is why today, many godly are becoming godless. Many godly are becoming godless. Because these people, they are increasing in riches. And I am warning you, what he says, for those who desire to be rich, I keep begging you, don't desire to be rich. Don't desire to be rich. There is nothing wrong with being rich. It is the Lord that makes us rich. But don't make it a drive, a pursuit. You have this passion, please, don't let anything exceed your passion, for the Lord. Be passionate, please, in God. Be passionate about obeying him. I am telling you, the blessings of the Lord will make you rich. But when you are living blessed by the Lord, and you begin to pursue riches, you will not be blessed. The Bible says, A faithful man aboundeth in sin, but he who makes haste to be rich, will not be innocent. When I thought about this, it was too painful for me, until I went into the sanctuary of God. Then, I understood their end. Eh? Surely, you set them in simple places. You cast them down to destruction. Oh! How they are brought to mission. As in a moment. They are utterly consumed with dread. As when one awakes. So Lord, when you are awake, you despise their image. When you say, when the Lord awakes, what does that mean? Eh? As if, he was, as if he was sleeping. But for how long does it take a man to sleep? It takes for a while. Eh? All we are seeing today, will you be able to see with the eye of God, that it takes for a while? It takes for a while, eh? We may endure through the night, but joy comes in the morning. Don't let us change sides. Don't let us, don't let us ever, eh? Never ever, underrate, eh? The God in our life, as first and foremost. Eh? Our whole duty, what God brought us for in life, eh? To fulfill Him and keep His command. Eh? All these things, will be added to, don't let us, don't let them become our preoccupation. So that, we don't have, we don't, it does not be, it does not happen, that the Lord did not answer, in the day of our troubles. Rather, I want us to close, as we go back to that Psalm 91, back to that Psalm 91. Go back to that Psalm 91. And close with that scripture. That Psalm 91. Close with that scripture. Let's close with the scripture. You know, close with that scripture. Let's go there. Let's go there. We want to pray that scripture. Just, read that scripture as well. You are praying it for yourself, where you are. Brethren online, you that are here, open your Bible, just be praying that scripture to yourself. Just be praying the scripture to yourself. In verse 11. Lord, you will give your angels charge over me. You keep me in all my ways. Brethren, we need the assignment of angels so much today. There is so much evil in the land. We need the assignment of angels. For you, Lord, give your angels charge over me. To keep me in all my ways. They will bear me off. I will not dash my foot, sister. I will not fall, I will not be caught. The sudden decision of the wicked will not overtake. The angels will bear me off their hands. The lions will be. Several lions. Death in the west. People that are caught in shock. People. Cubs. Wicked people. All over the land. I shatter them. I tread upon cubs. I cover. I shall tread upon young lions. I shall tread upon serpents. Under my foot, I will tread upon them. This shall be my portion. As I fear the Lord. I fear the Lord. As I dwell in a secret place. This shall be my portion. O Lord. Because I have set my love upon you. Because I have set my love upon you. Lord, deliver me. Lord, as I set my love upon you, you will deliver me. Lord, you will deliver me. Lord, you will set me on high as I reference your name. Your name will be my fear. In all I do, in all I think, in all I say, in all I do, your name will be my fear. And as I reference your name, Lord, you will set me on high. I will not be beneath. I will not be under. I will not be under. I will not be beneath. You will set me on high. You will set me on high. Lord, I will call upon you and you will answer me. I will call upon you and you will answer me. Lord, you will be with me in trouble. You will be with me in trouble. I will run into your name. Your name will be be my strong tower. Lord, and in my trouble you will deliver me and you will honor me. You will deliver me and you will honor me. You will deliver me and you will honor me. Lord, with long life, you will satisfy me. With long life, you will satisfy me. And you will show me your salvation. There is a saying among the Yorubas that you have to make a choice. One who is a person then you have to make a choice. If you are a person then you have to be a person. But what this psalm is saying is in the reverse direction. It is possible to have a good long life. That's what it is saying. You see, with long life I will satisfy him. That long life I will show him my salvation. It's possible to live long and yet not be visited with evil. It's possible. It's possible. And that is our prayer. That Lord, you will satisfy me with long life. And in the length with which you satisfy me, I will not be visited with evil. I will not be visited with evil. I will not be visited with evil. In the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, everlasting Father. May the Lord answer us in the day of our trouble. May the Lord answer us when we cry. May the Lord answer us when we call upon him. May the Lord be with us and undertake for us in the days of our fear. In the name of Jesus Christ. May we walk through the valley of the shadow of death. May we pray to him in the name of Jesus Christ. Even in the presence of our enemy, the Lord will be prepared for us. And our company will be overflowing. In the name of Jesus Christ. Surely, let us take that together. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me. The last time, surely goodness and mercy shall follow me. All the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever and ever. Amen.

All of us can quote it offhand. But you know, I just want to connect some earlier verses with that John 3.16. I've done that in some of our earlier discussions but I feel I should start from there this evening. This great salvation, our consideration actually is in the book of Deuteronomy. That's where we come to really sit down to look at scriptures, compare scriptures with scripture. But I want us to look at something in opening up this this great salvation. Look at how the Lord opened up this great salvation for us. When you look at John chapter 3 from verse 13. No one has ascended to heaven but he who came down from heaven, that is the son of man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. Now, the Lord Jesus was opening up the gospel, our this great salvation. In opening up the matter of our salvation, he told us that, look it is as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness. Even so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. Abul said that, he now opened up the great verse of the scripture, John 3.16. I don't know which language. I think I was reading a statistic one time. It says how many thousands of languages have this verse of the scripture translated, this John 3.16. For you to know how popular this verse is. The popular John 3.16, For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. In opening up the matter of our salvation, the Lord Jesus raised a matter that we are going to look into more intimately this evening where going to look into him more intimately this evening he said it is as nothing lifted up the serpent in the wilderness that is how the son of man will be lifted up that whosoever believe in him should not perish but have eternal life and why is god doing this why is god lifting up jesus why why he's telling not the reason why god is lifting up jesus why did it lifting him up the reason is a diverse thing what is the reason because god so loves the world the reason why god is lifting up the son is because god so loved the world i want to ask is there anything in the world for which the world should belong now you know when you say the words here the bible is not referring to the word sister it's talking about the world of humanity the human race please is there anything to love in the human race of course we know that there is nothing when we go to romans chapter 5 it made it clearer that god commanded his love towards us being that's why we were yes sinner christ died for us he said some may dare to die for a godly man but this is what god did that while we are yet his enemy god died for us so ordinarily there was nothing to love in the world there was nothing but you see hallelujah in opening up the matter of eternal life for us because in the matter of eternal life he opened up the matter of eternal life the lord jesus said it is because god so loved the world that god opened up the matter of eternal life you know what i want us to see today even though at times we we do make reference to it but we want to look at it in the little more closely today now what is it for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes will not perish but have it everlasting life i want to ask according to scriptures when exactly was the son giving when was the son giving to the world is that is that very correct someone says validation of the world is that very very correct so when the lord was saying that for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he's not talking about the fact that he came and that he's coming to die he's talking about something that god has put in place before the foundation of the world the coming of jesus christ was just when he came to us in time when he came to manifestation in the human time but actually actually what happened was that god gave jesus before the foundation of the world now look at it therefore he said for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes will not perish but have eternal life so that the spirit of the world will not perish but have eternal life so the last thing we need to do at this point is to get involved in the burymonger now we are looking at something very very very very very practical look at look at john chapter 17 before we open the pteronomy look at john 17 john 17 again calling it to your mind for some of us it will be a reminder for some of us will be coming to you very very new and very fresh but look at this scripture i'm reading from verse one did i spoke this word lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify your son that your son also may glorify you as you gave him authority as a living authority over our flesh that he should give eternal life for as many as you have given him please i want you to know something john chapter 17 verse 2 as you have given your authority over our flesh that you should give eternal life to as many as you have given him that's one come on this is eternal life that they may know you do it through god and you can bring your sense on and on i move on to verse 6 i have manifested your name to them to the man whom you are giving me out of the world are you following something verse 2 what did he say about eternal life he has been given power to give eternal life for those who god has what giving him please please please note those who were given to him when he came to barking i manifested your name to the men who you are giving me out of the world giving to him we move on again i move on to verse verse 9 i pray for them i do not pray for the world But for those whom you have watched, given me, for they are yours. How to be not in this world? Given him, given me. All, all, all mine are yours. And yours are mine. And I am glorified in them. Now I am no longer in the world. But these are in the world. And I came to you, Holy Father. Keep them through your name. Those who watch, whom you have watched, given me. That they may be one as we are one. While I was in the world, I kept them in your name. Those who watch, whom you have given. How to be not in this repetition and deliberate about it? Those whom you have given me, I have kept. And none is lost except the son of perdition. And the scripture might be fulfilled. But now I come to you. And these things I speak in the world. That they may have my joy to feed in themselves. I have given them your world. And the world has hated them. Because they are not of the world. Just as I am not of the world. I do not pray that you should take them out of the world. But that you should keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world. Just as I am not of the world. Sanctify them by your truth. Your word is truth. As you have sent me into the world. I have also sent them into the world. And for their sake, I sanctify myself. That they also may be sanctified by the truth. I do not pray for these alone. But also for those who will believe in me through their words. Please do not think this matter. Believe in me through their words. That they all may be one. As you are in me. And I am in you. That they also may be one in us. That the world may believe that you have sent me. And the glory which you gave me. I have given them. That they may be one. Just as we are one. Please. What do you notice in this prayer? What came out very clear in this prayer? You have given me. Given me. You have given me. You have given me. You have given me. You have given me. You have given me. Given me. Given me. Then what do you notice? Was he praying for only them? The prayer was only for them. But also for those that will do what? That will believe through them. So which means? Which means? Those that were giving to him were not just those 12 people. People that is going to believe, believe, believe, believe, believe. Eh? Is God so great? Is God so great? Is God so you? Is God so me? Is God so you? Your eternity? People will be believing. Those that are being given. Forget the point. Everybody who come to believe. Eh? How are they seeing? From the point of Jesus. Those that were what? That were giving for him. I want us to get this very, very clear. Get this very, very clear. Now, if you can get that very clear. Let's now go to the psalm. Let's go to the psalm. Deuteronomy chapter 7. I've laid the foundation that I want to lay in the New Testament. Let's go to chapter 7. Deuteronomy chapter 7. I read from verse 1. When the Lord your God bring you into the land, we shall go to a process. And has cast out many nations before you. The Ethiopians. The Gathites. The Amorites. The Canaanites. The Perizzites. The Hivites. The Jebusites. Several nations greater and mightier than you. Several nations. What? Greater and mightier than you. The nations, they are greater, they are mightier than you. I will explain that later as we go on. And when the Lord your God deliver them over to you. Please, I want you to be noting something. In the verse 1. When the Lord your God bring you into the land, we shall go to process. And has cast out many nations before you. Who is casting them out? Good. Verse 2. When the Lord your God deliver them over to you, who is delivering them to you? Your God. Now, why is he the one casting them out? Why is he the one delivering them to you? Why? Because there are nations greater and mightier than you. Than them. Israel was greater and mightier than those nations. They don't need God. Are you getting it? But the reason why it is God that is dragging them out. What is the reason? These nations, they are what? They are greater. They are mightier than them. The importance of what I am trying to say. Eh? Is that, if the battles of your life are the battles you can fight. Eh? You don't need God. If the things that are to confront us in our journey. Are the things that we cannot do. Then we don't need God. But the reason why it is God that is delivering. Why it is God that is casting out. Is it God? Is it God? Because the nations that we want to take their land, they are what? They are greater and they are mightier than us. And like I said during the marriage forum on Saturday. We spoke about the tongue. And I said, can anybody tame the tongue? Can anybody tame the tongue? No man can by himself tame the tongue. Why? The tongue is a nation. That is what? That is greater and mightier than you. Eh? Are you aware that no man can undo sin? Eh? Because sin is what? Is greater and mightier than you. Are you aware that honestly you are not much for the devil? Eh? Why? Because he is greater and is mightier than us. Bear in mind that even before God. Before, when there was no sin in man, he brought sin. Not to nantalk of, after man is in sin, he can still multiply his sin. Are you understanding me? It's a nation greater and mightier than us. We talk about privileges and powers, do lots of justice, which we can get in every place. We are no match for them. Do you know why? Only in ourselves. What are they? They are nations greater and mightier than us. We are talking about the powers of darkness. Physically, we are no match for them. What are they? They are nations greater and mightier than us. We are talking about the battles of life that we are to confront. We are no match for them. They are what? Nations greater and mightier than us. I am trying to count seven greater and mightier nations. You know you can't count seven greater and mightier nations. I am trying to count for you. Nations. Nation of sin. Nation of faith. The nation of the tongue. The nation of the world. The nation of the devil. Nation of if-if. If-if. Is that what it means? The nation of the subtlety and the wickedness of men. The nation of even your own weakness. Even if you have your own weakness. Your own human infirmity. For some of us the nation of our anger. For some of us, the nation of our pride. Eh? This what we call pride of the world. What our sister was telling us on Saturday? The sister. What want to kill you now Is pride of life If not for God That nation will have done what Will have conquered us There are so many nations In fact I don't have many nations Our own nations But I'm not trying to count those nations for you Now There are nations I'm talking about this great salvation This great salvation And I'm taking you somewhere Huh Now You see this nation They are getting their might here And God Will be the one Number one to do what To cast them out Number two to do what To drive them out Number three to do what To deliver them Where Into Their hand Let's go on Now He says He says I want the Lord God to deliver them to you You shall conquer them And utterly destroy them I want you to know that before you can conquer There was a delivery Huh Before you could conquer There was a delivery into your hand Are you understanding me Now You shall conquer them And utterly destroy them You shall make no covenant with them Nor show mercy to them Nor shall you make marriages with them You shall not give your daughters to their son Nor take their daughters for you You shall not give your daughters to their son For They will turn your son away from following me And serve other gods So that the anger of the Lord Will arise Against you And destroy you suddenly But thus you shall deal with them You shall destroy their altar Break down their sacred stone Crush down their wooden image Burn Their carved images with fire Now Verse 15 Verse 7 Verse 6 Verse 7 And verse 7 For you are what For you are what Please we're looking at your bible For you are what For you are what A holy people You are a holy A holy people Now Not just are you a holy people Please check the telegraph And confirm that Do it now with us To just confirm Are we on together with the burden on life? Okay, okay They are giving us signal, thank you Now He said for you are a holy people To the Lord Your God The Lord your God Please listen to something The Lord You are a holy people to the Lord your God The Lord your God Has worked Has worked Has chosen you To be A people for Himself Please quickly compare that with Ephesians chapter 1 Please quickly compare that with Ephesians chapter 1 Please somebody go to Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians 1 Let's quickly see Ephesians chapter 1 Let's see something there in Ephesians chapter 1 I want to quickly I want to quickly compare something Ephesians 1 I read from verse From verse 3 Blessed be the God And Father of our Lord Jesus Christ Who has Blessed us With every spiritual blessing In the heavenly places in Christ Just as He chose us In Him When Before the foundation Of the world For you are a holy people To the Lord your God For the Lord your God Has chosen you To be a people for Himself Just as He has chosen us In him Before the foundations of the world That you should be holy Please look at this verse very well For you are a holy people To the Lord your God For you are a holy people To the Lord your God Lord your God. For the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for himself. Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4, just as he chose you in him before the foundations of the world that you should be holy without blame before him in love. Is that a difference? Is that a difference? Is that a different bedroom? There is no difference. There is no difference. The Lord God has chosen them. What of we? When were we chosen? We have also been, there was something that was done. We were chosen in him. Now look at something. For a special schedule above all the people on the face of the earth. Now verse 7, brethren please let's look at something. The Lord did not set his love on you nor chose you because you are more in number than any other people. So why were they chosen? Because they were more number? Because they were better people? Because they were more qualified? If you talk about number, there are better people to choose. The point I'm making is that these great salvation. If you find yourself in it you should understand that's not because you are better. It's just because you are chosen. It's not because you are better. It's just because you are chosen. It's not because there are no people mightier and better and greater than you. But it's not because of any other reason, but because you were chosen. Now you say because the Lord your God has got this EQ? set this love, the love of God did not set this love on you nor chose you because you are more in number than any other people. For you were the least of all people. Please, I want you to compare this. Compare this with 1 Corinthians chapter 1. We are just making the comparison. This great salvation. 1 Corinthians 1. Towards the end of that 1 Corinthians chapter 1. I read from verse 26. For you see your calling brethren that not many wise according to the flesh, nor many mighty, nor many nobles are what are called. Are you following something? Not many what? Wise. Not many what? Mighty. Not many what? Nobles are called. But God has chosen what? The foolish sins of the world. So what are we? What are we ordinarily? We are the foolish sins of the world. I'm talking about this great salvation. See, I'm going somewhere. I'm going. I want to show you something. Something that they don't show me and you know, as we're running up intimacy with God. You're running up intimacy with God. Let's draw closer to this God. Eh? The best of your life is in God. Let me just tell you the truth. The best that you can become is inside God. Outside God, you will be a shadow of yourself. You may have riches so you may have money. But what it means to enjoy life is not about riches. It means about riches. Who follows, who follows the media recently? What's happening on those things? Who follows the media recently? What's happening on those things? Who follows the media recently? Something happened just over the weekend. Eh? Among the, the, the people you call the Caliber, the, the, the the Morgani organization of the state. Eh? They got into the, they got into the place. They found a man and his wife dead. Inside the house. At the gate was the police security officer's house. You don't know the kind of house. You don't know houses that where you live, where you live. Where police will be detained, will be at the gate. Are you understand, are you understand the kind of house? They were found inside there. The story that is going on now, that is still being investigated, still going on, and from the investigation that is still going on, was that the man killed the wife because the wife was asked to get asked, asked, asked. They find out much certain. Then they found the man dead. They found, they found full bottle of sniper. So, right now, the news so far is he killed the wife and then he committed suicide, Caden said. I'm talking of people that have, ehm, inside the home, how many felicitations in those states? How many that kind of person? Eh? If you think your best is in money, you don't understand life. He said, for all of that, should some people die like that? Should they die like that? They should not die like that. I'm talking about your, I'm talking about fulfilling life. I'm talking about not just, you see, we have good sources. Not just sources, but good sources. The best of your life is in God. And I'm showing you something. That when God was choosing you, God was not choosing you because you have capacity to enter heaven by yourself. Oh, are you understanding me? God was not choosing you because you are the wisest. No. He's not choosing you because you are the smartest. No. He wasn't thinking, He was not looking for you because you are the best that can make it to heaven if you are to take the race and run it. No. That was not the basis. In fact, when God was making the choice, God was looking for what? Those that are foolish in the face of the world. He said He was looking for He was looking for those what's the next thing? Let me go back to that for instance. He said but He chose the foolish things of the world to shame the things that are wise. Eh? God chose the foolish to do what? To shame the wise. Do you know the way Goliath looked at David? Eh? Do you know what the Bible says? The Bible says and he you know, he despised him. He despised him. Why? Why did Goliath despise David? Because he unarmed before him. Eh? Me. Me. Me. Me. He was not looking at the things. Eh? Should I just smash it down? You know the way he was looking at the things. He said, am I a dog? You came to me with sticks. Sticks. Sticks. Me, Goliath, that the whole army of Israel, the whole army of Israel, they were running away. Tonight came with sticks and stones. Me, am I a dog? The Bible says and he cursed David in the name of God. Because coming out to him was an embarrassment, was an insult. What was God doing? God was choosing the things that are not. To do what? To save the things that are. That is what God did at your salvation. Are you understanding me? That is what He did at your salvation. If you were the best, if you had all it takes to make heaven, God will not choose you. Are you understanding me? It is those who can, who can by themselves they cannot take over the nation. They will need God to help them drive out the nation. They will need God to help them deliver the nation to their hand. They will need God to help them fight the nation. Those were the ones that God chose. Are you understanding me? Those are the ones He chose. The battles of your life and you are getting overwhelmed. Brother, sister, oh you are not getting it right. It is because you forgot that at the point of relation in the first place, you are not matched for the battle. Are you understanding me? You are not a match for that battle that you want to fight. If you are a match for the battles of your academics, if you are a match for the battle of your prosperity, if you are a match for the battle of your success, if you are a match for the battle of eternal life, then you will not have been chosen in the first place. When God was choosing you, God knew very well that you are not a match for what you want to fight. He knows. If you are overwhelmed by that, oh brother and sister, you are not getting it right. You are not getting it right. If you are overwhelmed by the battles of your life, you look here, you look there, can I make a rule? This kind of my person, this kind of my life, this kind of my weakness, this kind of my shortcomings, a person like me like this, hey, hey, and don't think because you look at yourself and you discover that you cannot, eh, that is why you were chosen in the first place. Am I making sense to you? Are you getting it, brethren? Are you getting it, brethren? He said, but God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. God has chosen the, the what? The weak things. Bro, see, are you feeling weak? You look back and forth into your life and you say, ah, it cannot be right. Brother, it can be right. Sister, it can be right. It can be right. Because God saw all the weakness. God saw, you see, do you know why, do you know why the Israelites said they were like grasshoppers before they suffered? Do you know why they said so? I hope you know the reason. Eh? The Israelites, they were worse. They were, they were archimedes, short-sighted people. Do you know why they want to take their land? They were looking, you know why you want to fight somebody like this? You are looking at the first thing, no? So, when the father saw it, they began to weep. Ha ha ha God had brought us here to die. God had brought us here to die. Do you know that he force many forces at me to do You look at the battles, academically. You look at the battles spiritually. You look at the battle. Maritaly. Look at the battle from the point of your weaknesses. Look at the battle from the point of your final. Look at the battle from the point of your ability. Look at the battle, and you say, ahh. But man, it is not time to be discouraged. I've just come to tell you that this salvation is a great one. There is what makes this salvation great is that it is the weak things, it is the foolish things, it is the things that are not, that are gathered together to confront the big things. That is what makes this salvation a great one. It is the things that lack the ability to, you know, to enter. The things that in themselves they cannot do it. The things that in themselves, eh, they are not likely to get it right. If they will get it right by themselves, eh, they will not have been chosen. They will not have been. It is the two things that by themselves they are likely going to go into error, fall into disbelief. Those are the ones they gather. You know how Jesus gathered them? He gathered one Peter, one man that is Ehare Obale, another good man, one man that will not just rest himself. You know Peter now? Eh, he gathered one thousand tombs. He gathered one. You understand me? He just gathered one tax collector. He just gathered, gathered them and they said that, ah, Mr. man, you must be a glutton yourself. How will you be? How is it that these kind of people that you can gather? You do not see better people. And what did Jesus tell them? He said, look, eh, those, it is those that are sick, that need you, that look in physician. Those who are well, do they need a physician? They need a physician. What I am trying to tell you, if you are not sick, if there is not something that makes you to feel, I cannot go, I am not well, I will not be able to make it, you will not have been chosen. Eat everything about Jesus. Ah, ha. jakby ain't, we don't need you. And I want to tell you that, it it it it it, it is a method with God. He said, I will show you why it is a method with God. He said, I say God, choose this weak thing, to put yourself with things that are mighty. And the best things of this world, hallelujah. The base. Eh? The base, what are the base? Eh? Base, do you know what is a base? Eh? The, the gives you tomorrow, eh? Eh? The job of the neighbor. Eh, . Eh, Behars. If God gives you correctly, you will see the truth, if you give in to God, what kind of meaning you will see tomorrow in your life? Eh? In your life. Eh, all your life. So counselee muslim , eh, great, the Estella thank you brother the one you will march down the one that you just march it down and pass over them the best things of the world the one that look like I cannot become anything it is like God it is those kinds of people the best things of this world and the things we shall despise God has chosen the things which are not to bring to shame the things that are that no flesh should glory where? In his presence. You see, you see, this great salvation, let me tell you one thing about it. What makes it great is that at the end of the day, only God will take the glory. Are you following me? Only God wants to take that work that glory. I'm showing you a great salvation. We are inside a salvation that the person who brought us together, he alone wants to be the one that fought all the battle. He alone wants to be the one that stole all the gold. He doesn't want you to sell any gold. He wants to do all the calling for you. You shall be happy. Hey, go number four. Go number five. Go number six. You'll be happy. But there is a God that is calling the goal for you. We are more than conquerors. Through him, we'll love and give his life for us. He wants us to be more than conquerors. He will fight the battle and he will give us the victory. He said, I the Lord will do what? I will cut them out. I will drive them out. You will then conquer them. Hallelujah! Oh! Our God will drive them out. Our God will cut them out. We will not do what? We will not conquer them. The Lord will say, hey, this boy gets power. The boy gets power. The boy will not get power. He has no power. The sickness of his life is through the God that brought him into salvation. That God that brought him is able to finish it. All the weaknesses. He saw all the shortcomings. He saw all the inability. He saw the fact that ah, I will need to, the Bible says I will first see that I will be confused. I didn't understand the English. He saw all of them. Hallelujah! Everything. This means that he just won't see. Why did I, why was I involved to this father? That his weakness is anger. The anger now is also in my life. He saw it before he said you need to be meek. He saw it. I don't know what you are calling in your family or in your history. I don't know where you are bringing it together. But what I'm trying to make you understand, that heaven saw all those things that will disqualify you from entering. All those things that will make you not able to enter. That is why heaven was insisted in you. If there was nothing that will disqualify you, if there was nothing that will make you not able, heaven will not have taken you in the first place. You were taken. You were chosen. Because we saw in you that you cannot enter by yourself. That was why we chose you. It's a great salvation. Eh? The person who started it wants to take all the glory. Oh! I'm not making sense to you. The person who started it, the person who did everything, also wants to finish it. He doesn't want it to involve you. He wants to beat the one that will catch them out. He wants to beat the one that will drag them out. You'll just be taking the victory. Just keep conquering them. Just keep conquering them. And that is why the Bible says, God resists the proud. Because the secret of your victory is in him. The secret of your standing is in him. The secret of your life is where? It's in him. It's in yourself. Don't focus on yourself. Don't focus at yourself. Don't focus at your inabilities. Don't focus. Oh! The way everything has gone, I wish I could rewrite it. Maybe it would have been better for me in life. I said, look, from this point, if you begin to look at Jesus, he can still rewrite it. And he said that, but you see, he says, you see, time. I said, listen to me. Eh? God is not subject to time and does not pay tribute to time. He wanted to prove that to us. That is why he made Abraham understood that look. He made him to understand that, look, you, you, you don't need to be in a hurry. Even after the body is dead, everything is dead. Eh? There is still a plan for his son. That's why the Bible says, after Job, look at everything that God took from Job. You give back to a child in one day, child fully grow. It's not like a bag of cement that you buy in the market. You just put it right. You've got to take in all the weight. But even the children. But what did God do about time? The Bible says, and God gave Job again other than years. Because he does not pay tribute to time. Who told you that if he wanted to enjoy time, he would not enjoy? Why did you narrow down your life into that narrow bucket? Who called you? He is more than able. The Lord was speaking to them. He said so that no man should glory in his presence. Huh? You say, I don't know if it's the Romans chapter 7. He said, the Lord did not set his love on you nor chose you because you were more in number than any other people. For you were the least of all people. Eh? Then look at the second thing. Eh? Look at the second thing, which is the greatness of them all. Hallelujah, brethren. Hallelujah, brethren. Hallelujah! We are going to sing this hymn. I'm going to watch it. It's a quarter past six. We are going to, I'm going to start singing. I'm going to, please, everywhere you are, brethren, on Telegram, on Missla, go and get the hymn. In Christ alone, my hope is found. Please, open it in advance. By quarter after six, we'll be singing that hymn. And if you want to download it, please download it. If you have the hymn, please do something. Brethren who are here, please download. In Christ alone, my hope is found. He commands my destiny from birth to death. He is able to finish what he has begun. We are going to sing that hymn. We are going to sing that hymn. This great salvation. Eh? For God so loved the world. Oh, hallelujah! God so loved the world. Look at the second thing I'm showing you. I'm showing you in Psalm 77. Psalm 77. He says, you are the least. Now, verse 8. He says, but because. Please listen. Listen to why God set his love on them. Listen to why God is bringing them into the land. Listen to why God wants to do it. Please listen. Listen very well. That because the Lord loves you. Eh? Why did he love them? They don't know. Can they tell? Can we tell? We don't know. For God so loved. He said, because the Lord loves you. Eh? Hallelujah! Because the Lord loves you. Then look at the next thing. And because he will keep what? What will he keep? The hope. Which what? His word for your father. The Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of bondage. From the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Israel. The king of Egypt. Sorry. Please listen. Eh? Why did God marshal your salvation? Why did he marshal your salvation? Number one, for God so loved the world. Is that not? Is that not? What's the second level? He said, because the Lord has for a world a hope to who? To their father. So, the baby of dealing with them. Why God is bringing them out? To bring them to that land. Is that God has made a hope. There is a hope. There is a hope. Sorry. That hope that is with their father. God is there to fulfill that hope. Eh? And so God is bringing them. Eh? As a fulfillment of the hope. And hope is in place. Are you following me, brethren? Are you following me, brethren? Let me tell you, brethren. Listen to me. The reason why God is bringing you to heaven is because God has given you to Jesus. Oh! Oh! Are you understanding me? Are you understanding me? There is something that God gave to you. I have given you this one. This one is coming to you. Because God made this. There is this hope that is with your father. That God. What did he say? When he was speaking about Jesus. The priesthood of Jesus. Eh? He said God swore to him that forever you are a priest after the order of the sister. Are you understanding me? And that priesthood is about what? He said this is the priesthood. He said therefore he is able to save them completely. Those who by him come to God. Since once he ever lived, he is a priest forever. What does he need to do? To make intercession for them. There is a hope that has been given to Jesus. Hope must be fulfilled. This is why God is bringing you. Oh! Brethren, are you understanding something? Are you understanding something? What I am trying to make you understand? Eh? Listen to this. When God was speaking to Israel, he was to go and deliver them. What did he tell him? What did he say Moses should tell them? Tell them! The God of your father. Who? Abraham. The God of who? Isaac. The God of who? Jacob. I don't know. I have sent me. So, there was something in hand with those people. Are you understanding me? That was why he came to them to take them. Listen to me. The God that comes to you is the God of our Lord Jesus. Jesus Christ. Oh! Are you understanding me? The God that came to you is the God of who? The God of our Lord Jesus Christ. The God of our Lord Jesus Christ. And let me tell you, what is in Jesus? What is in Jesus? What is in Jesus? Is greater. Is higher. Is eternal. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, because there is something that has been promised, there is something that has been discussed, that is why Jesus said, those who you have given me, eh, I did not, none of them, no one, no one, eh, got me free. Eh? No one. No one. The one you gave me, notice. All of them, they are intact. Eh? Eh? I'm telling you, there is something that has been sworn to him, that he shall be free forever after the order of rule of Messiah. And he's there forever. Because he's there forever, eh, he's able to do what? Eh? Save completely those who by him come to God. The basis of our coming. Hallelujah. The basis of God coming to them and making them enter is that there was something he promised to their father. The basis of you and me coming is not about us. Hallelujah. You know, when I think about it, it's not about me. What a great salvation. It's not about me. It's not consequent on me. It's not about me. It's not from me. It's not of me. Eh? It is about something that was between the father and the son. Same way for the Israelites. Was it about them? Was it about them? Was it from them? It was not. It was about what was done with the father. What I'm trying to make you understand, that that which you see is a shadow of that which is to come. What you are seeing God doing with them in that place is a shadow of what God is to come. We will not have the softer. Are you understanding me? If I would say that, eh, because God has to create a better thing for us, they cannot be perfected without us. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are the softer. We are the real thing. The real thing. The real thing. We are the we are the softer. They are the shadows. We are the softer. The softer of the matter, eh, is that there is a work between the father and the son. It is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Eh? It is the love of God. Eh? It is the fellowship of the Spirit. It's about them. It's not about us. It's about them. Just like for them too. You will say, oh, eh, you flow from what I swore to your father, but to just the hope that I have with your father. You think of Satan many times in dealing with them? You say, but because of my promise to Abraham, because of oh, that is why many times you will not pray for something you will see. Eh? You will not ask for deliverance, you will get it. Eh? Sometimes you will pray wrongly, God will answer you rightly. Eh? Oh! I'm going to give thanks to you. Eh? I'm just telling you to understand this great salvation. It is a great salvation. Brethren, it is a great salvation. It is a great salvation that we are very ready to. We cannot get confidence in this salvation. Oh! Let's go now. It is quarter past eight. Brethren, let's go to that thing. I'm not going to download it to my home here. Oh! Let's sing together. Oh! Let's go together. Brethren, wherever you are, who can give us the tune of that hymn again? Pam, pam, pam, pam. Brethren, I'm not hearing you. Come closer. Come closer. In Christ alone, my hope is found. So let's go together, brethren. Let's go one, two. In Christ alone, my hope is found. He is my light, my strength, my song. This cornerstone, this solid ground, comes to the field, says God, and come. What eyes of love, what depths of peace, when fear of peace, when strivings cease.

that to Luke No power of hell No scheme of man No power of hell No scheme of man Oh from the first cry to final breath Jesus commands my destiny I will score all the goals Because he will drive us He will cast us and I will conquer He will drive us He will cast us and why I will conquer He will drive us He will cast us but I will conquer Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah In the name of

we say Lord our God speak to our situations in the name of Jesus meet us where we need you most in the name of Jesus thank you eternal Father blessed be your holy name our God in Jesus name we pray Amen yeah we have been looking at this matter of his cross and we have been looking at Luke chapter 9 verse 23 that has been the test we have been considering under the theme this topic we started over two months now his cross and we have been looking at different aspects of this matter and we have been looking at different aspects of this matter of the cross and in the last two weeks we have been focusing on Luke chapter 9 Luke chapter 9 around verse 18 there about to the matter from around verse 18 and we have been looking at that all through the to verse 25 we this episode we have been considering had been the discussion of Jesus with his disciples who when he was asking them the question of his identity that's from around verse 18 and it happened as he was alone praying that the disciples joined him and he asked them saying who do the crowd say that I am so they answered and said John the Baptist but some say Elijah and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again he said to them but who do you say that I am Peter answered and said the Christ of God and he strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and sheep priests and scribes and killed and be raised the third day then he said to them if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me for whoever desires to save his life will lose it and whoever desires to sorry but whosoever loses his life for myself for my sake for my sake will save it for what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world and he himself destroyed or lost that has been the text we have been reading and we have been considering the our emphasis has been on the verse 23 verse 23 of the selected text where it said whosoever desires to be my disciple let him deny himself and we have looked at the matter of let him deny himself in the past two weeks now we saw that except a man understand the love of God fundamentally we have considered the truth that except a man understand the love of God he cannot deny himself and secondly we have noted that the reason why we are to live for Jesus why our life should be centered on glorifying Jesus is that it is the coming of Jesus that that gave our soul its value once you remove Jesus from our soul then our soul is lost there is nothing valuable we gain in our soul Jesus is the only one that gives our soul value and then last week we were able to look at this matter of letting deny himself we considered Romans chapter 12 verse 1 but to have a proper understanding of that Romans chapter 12 we have to take our reading from chapter 11 so that we can properly situate that verse 1 of Romans chapter 12 correctly where he said I therefore beg you brothers and sisters that you present your body a living sacrifice I therefore beseech you by the mercies of God I beg you by God's mercies that brothers and sisters that you present your body a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God and last week we were able to consider the matter to see that nothing again can be reasonable nothing can be reasonable than for us to consider this mercy that we receive and as a consequence of that present our body the entirety of our life everything as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God that was our consideration last week as we normally do we do we do please I want to something occurred to me after our discussion last week and I think I should raise it now please our brethren you are online you are on telegram misla and you are connecting with us please we have been looking at this matter of this cross for a while now I want to I want to I want to throw it open to you that please if there are questions on your mind if there are things that constitute questions something that we have said that they are not clear or you you want clarification on on them please put your question through to us the technicals we we work on this you will get it you can place it on misla you will get it you can put it on telegram you will get it you can also come on whatsapp on the whatsapp group if you are on our whatsapp group please there are questions in your mind there are things you want us to undo please let us begin to have them so that we can be treating the questions as we are going on this matter please so last week I said we considered Romans 11 12 and I don't know for those of us who are here physically if there are one or two things we have to say whether by way of contribution by way of comment by way of question by way of testimony by way of sharing in relation to the matters that we are considered last week so let me ask our brethren why here physically is there anyone that have anything to say anything to say okay so nobody have anything to say for our brethren why here physically so let's go to that verse that we have been considering luke chapter 9 luke chapter 9 and when we look at that verse we um since then he said to them all he said to them all if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself that is what we have been considering let him deny himself and this denying himself the two things we have considered have just alighted them now we want to go to this matter of letting deny himself we have looked at living for jesus is the essence why our life should glorify jesus is because he's the one that gives our life a value let us evaluate the mercy of god and that message should make us see why we should live for him now let him deny himself let him deny himself we want to look at this matter in the order that in the other um dimension or the other side to it that have been that we could not get into last week and to look at this this other side to it um let him deny himself i want us to to see something that the bible says stated very very clearly and it seems to me today that um uh maybe it is it is not properly emphasized it again or maybe it is uh will i say forgotten or not not considered a very crucial our christian work and i first wanted to read philippians chapter 1 verse 29 let him deny himself ......... ............ and say I want to look at Philippians 1.29 Philippians chapter 1 verse 29 please if you are there before me you can begin to read I will amplify for the online brethren from here in case you are there before me Philippians chapter 1 verse 29 NLT knowing this Philippians chapter 1 verse 29 which version is that please King James unto you it has been granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake let him deny himself this is the other side we couldn't get to last week because we have to expand the matter of understanding that the only reasonable thing we can do is to present our body a living sacrifice now we are seeing a very important thing here that you notice immediately Jesus said in that Luke chapter 1 verse 29 in that Luke 9 he said who do people say that I am and then the disciples mentioned several names you who do you say that I am they said you are the Christ ok so you are the Christ he said you are the Christ so get this don't tell anybody this until I have been glorified he said because a son of man will be rejected suffered humiliated by the sheep priests and scribes he will be killed he will die he will come back to life the resurrection and then before he now said if any man will be by let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me now we are seeing in this place that one thing that we must understand about our Christian work this is cross is that it is given to us it is given this is one thing that is given I can they can just say It is given am I correct is there another another rendering nlt what you have been given you have been given oh not only the privilege of trusting in Christ oh you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ what about the privilege of you see what the bible calls it 229 00 tę palette a privilege to suffer for him it is a thing we must understand that when people hate you for the sake of christ it's a privilege it's a blessing when people call you evil you know i'm quoting um the beatitude they said are you i i hope i'm quoting correctly let me just see that uh correctly uh beatitude that matthew chapter five matthew five around that should be around verse 11 there about let me quickly get to that place it's from around verse 10 blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for that is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when they revile and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for grace is your reward in heaven for so they persecuted the prophet who were before you it is important for us to know that it is a privilege to suffer for christ it is not it is not what i say is that it is not a suffering to suffer for christ i don't know that i'm making sense to you it is not a suffering to suffer for christ it is a privilege it is a blessing to suffer for christ so the matter of let him deny himself she also be understood from this standpoint that if anybody wants to follow me let him understand that he has been granted the privilege of not only believing in him but what but also to suffer for his sake it is a blessing huh and you know the lord jesus made a statement here that for so they persecuted the prophet that are before you i want us to check this this service the matter in hebrews chapter 11 where he talked about the heroes of faith the heroes of faith in hebrews chapter 11 the heroes of faith now you will notice that he's talking about these heroes of faith the bible spoke to both sides and i did emphasize that when we read this scripture some weeks back when we look at hebrews chapter 11 from verse 31 he says for by faith the initiates me did not perish with those who did not believe when she received despise with peace and what more shall i say for the time will fail me to tell of githem and barack and we will finally know when she les這 Ал 재미 combieninf of uncoma was written in the story of history when she received the spies with peace and what more shall i say samson and jephthah also of david and samuel and the prophets now look at the two sides please look at these verses very closely looking at the two sides what is he talking about here our men were able to obtain a good report is that not he said they obtained a good report through faith so he was talking about the report that they received now he said through faith they subdued kingdom is that a good report is that a good report yes they wrote righteousness is that not a good report yes they obtained promises is that a good report yes they stopped the mouth of the lions that was a good report what they did through faith they quenched the violence of fire wow how does that sound how does that sound powerful great stopping the mouth of the lion quenched the violence of fire i hope you know the person who quenched the violence of fire who are those people the three people they entered fire you could not do them anything they escaped the edge of the sword out of our witness were made strong became valiant in battle rabbi says um um fainting but pursuing remember gideon when he was pursuing those people he said they became very anti-battle they turned to fight the armies of the aliens this if you look at all of this how does this sound a demonstration of power is underneath is that not it demonstration of miracle uh we move on again to 35 women receive their dead raised up to life and come back to life what is being displayed power of god through faith but also look at it keep talking about faith others were what were tortured what what are they also expressing faith but we don't look at this as faith we look at this as suffering we look at it as you know this side we don't talk about this other side of faith they were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection they refused any deliverance oh are you seeing the faith talking about do you see that this expression of power this There's expression of mureku, there's expression of victory, even the submitting to death and dying and suffering is also faith. But that is what we don't want to talk about today, as expression of faith. We'll call it expression of defeat. We'll say that one is not part of faith. It is only to receive mureku, to receive signs, to do good deeds, to do good deeds. That is what we are talking about, faith. We are not taking the total gospel. Both sides is expression of faith. They are good reports. It's a good report to be tried by mureku. It's a good report to obtain scourging, weeping because of faith. It's a good report to be in shame and imprisonment. It's also a good report. It's not only when we... It's not only when we perform miracles. It's not only when there is food on the table that we are talking about faith. But that there is no food on the table, and there is no money to buy the food, and I refuse to steal, and I endure hunger for his name's sake, it's also faith. That's the point the Bible is making. There is a dimension of... Let him deny himself. I'm talking about this dimension to our faith. Let him deny himself. This preparedness to suffer. And the preparedness to suffer is coming from the background that we understand that suffering for Jesus is what? It's what? It's a privilege. That is why you will observe, that what we mentioned earlier, when we were considering the cross, you can now understand the reason why Peter and John, when they were beating, flogged for the gospel. The Bible says they did what? Eh? They were rejoicing. Because they counted themselves what? Opportunity. Privilege. To suffer for Christ. It was a privilege to suffer for Christ. So, that gives you the background to why they were rejoicing. Why? Because they understood, that it is not only giving, not only giving to them to believe in Christ, but there is also the privilege of what? Of suffering for Him. And so, the Bible says still, um, useful statistics, still, others are try, others are tryers of mocking, of scourging, yes, of shame and imprisonment. Look at the 37. Eh? Look at 37. Look at what the Bible says. It says, they were stoned. They were stoned. They were sown in two. Eh? So, it's not only that, they stopped the mouth of the lion. Eh? They quenched the violent fire. It was also expression of faith, of any good report, when they were, when they took saw, eh? And they sawed them into two. Eh? They were, you know, you know, cut, boom, boom, boom, and they killed them. Eh? And they were not ready, eh? To deny that faith. And they died in the presence of that faith. It was also a good report. Why? Because we must understand, that if anybody want to follow Jesus, the first condition is, you must lose sight of yourself. You must lose sight of your interests. You must forget yourself. You must renounce yourself. You must, you must totally, totally please yourself. Subordinate yourself. Make yourself secondary. And whatever you think, you want to gain. So that, coming to Jesus, eh? Is not just making up our mind to come and gain. What is it? It's also making up our mind to come and suffer. And that suffering, what I am saying, suffering for Jesus, in the actual sense of it, is not suffering. From the point of the scripture, what is it? A privilege. And honor. It's a honor. A honor. There is this honor, of suffering, for Jesus Christ. Now, He said there were some, there were some in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. Eh? The bible says, they wandered about in sheep's skin. They wandered about, in sheep's skin. And God's skin. Being destitute. Afflicted. Tormented. What is the bible calling all of this? Faith. So, destitution is faith. Being afflicted, for the sake of our believing in Him, is an expression of faith. Eh? Going through torment, because of our believing in Him, Eh? Is an expression of faith. Faith is inaction. So, there must be this solid balance. There must be this solid balance, of let him deny himself. Then, before he comes through, let him take up his cross daily. So, there is this torment to suffer, and in the next verse, He said, of whom the world was not worthy, they wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth. All of these, not some of these, brethren, all of these, all of these, having obtained the what? A good testimony. Through what? Faith. So, a good testimony by faith, Eh? Is not just, the deliverance, the escaping, the stopping the mouth of the lion, is also destitution, is also torment, is also hunger, is also being killed, is also imprisonment, is also shame. All of these, they are good testimonies, as long as, it's an expression of faith. And that is the point that we are making. Let him deny himself. Let him, you know, and that is what the Lord was trying to say, when we look closely at that Luke chapter 9, that we, we have been considering, Luke chapter 9 that we have been considering, we will see that, the martyrs follow themselves, they follow themselves very closely. He says, from 22, the son of man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, and sheep priests, and scribe, and be killed, and be raised the third day. Then he said to them all, if anybody is there to come after me, let him deny himself, pick up his cross, daily, and follow me. And now, if you are not doing that, what exactly are you doing? Look at it. For whoever desires to save his life, if you don't lose your interest, if you don't forget about yourself, whosoever desires to save his life will lose it. Whosoever thinks he can save his life, and I keep telling people, eh, it is not wisdom, eh, to try to save a life that you cannot save. You cannot, the master made it clear that you cannot save it. And that is wisdom. And that is why I normally say that, that man is not a fool, eh, who, who, who gave to God, eh, what he cannot, what he cannot keep, eh, to obtain what he cannot lose. Hallelujah. The man is not foolish. He gave to God what he cannot keep. What can we not keep? We cannot keep our life. That is the reality of the scripture. You cannot keep it. Holy thing, eh, eh, don't let me, if I take the truth, I will lose my job. If I, if I don't compromise, I will not make it in life. If I, if I do this, eh, they will kill me. If I do that, I, they will not promote me. If I do that, all those things, you are wanting to, to live, a godly life. It says, whosoever, is that the next verse I will be going to? Whosoever, want to live a godly life in this world, must suffer what? The person must suffer persecution. If you want to be godly, then the only way to understand that, is to prepare your mind. Is to lose sight of yourself. Is to understand that, look, I am, I am, I, I will definitely, have to suffer for Jesus. And suffering is part of my call. It has been given to me, not only to believe in him. It has been given to me, to suffer for him. It is understanding that, that preparedness, eh, that is, that is a strong condition, you know, part and parcel, of let him deny himself. And you know, to say, whichever desire to save his life will lose it. What I am saying, brethren, is that, there is nothing you can do. As long as you are trying to save your life, let me tell you the truth, you will lose it. That's the reality, you will lose it. The best you can do, is to forget yourself, and remember only Jesus. The best you can do, is to live for Jesus. Because, as of us, as no matter how much you try to save your life, there is only a judgment waiting upon your head. That judgment is that, you will lose the life. It says, Whosoever will save it, will lose it. But whosoever loses his life for my sake, will save it. So, you see, you can see the contradiction, the paradoxical statement, eh, it looks foolish, but that is the wisdom of God. The more you are running away from living a godly life, so that you can save your life, the more you will lose it. The more you say, look, no matter what it will cost me, me oh, I will live a godly life. I am not going to do anything. I am going to live a godly life. Eh? What will I put on your life? You will save it. And please, don't forget, that the cross is the wisdom of God. And the cross is the power of God. Eh? It may sound foolish, eh, to those who are perishing. But for us, we believe, eh, Christ, the cross, is what? The wisdom of God. And what? The power of God. Everybody that runs away from godliness to preserve his or her life, will lose it. There is no how you try to do it. The end is that you will lose it. That's the end. On the final analysis, you will be a loser. May we not be a loser at last. May we not be losers at last. May we not be losers at last. May we not be losers at last. May we not be losers at last in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. He's so crucial. Eh? I normally make this statement. And honestly, it makes a lot of meaning to me. Where did I get this statement from? I actually got it from, ehm, Matthew 7. The issue of eh, the wise man, the wise builder, and the foolish builder. That's where I got that eh, eh, statement from. Where the Lord said, ehm, where is it now? Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven. I'm reading Matthew 7 from verse 21. But he who does the will of my Father in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, cast out demons in your name, and done many wonders in your name? And then I will declare to them, I never knew you. Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness. Then the Lord went further. Therefore, whoever hears these sayings of mine, hallelujah, whoever hears these sayings of mine, ehm, and does them. May that be our portion in the name of Jesus. We will be doers of his sayings. We will be doers of his word. May the Lord grant us a, a, a retained, you know, um, um, um, you know, the, the, the, the act of not just being a hearer, but a doer, a doer of scriptures, a doer of his will. Therefore, whoever hears these sayings of mine, ehm, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock, and the rain descended, and the flood came, and the wind blew, and built against that house, and built against that house, and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. It was founded on the rock. But everyone who hears these sayings of mine, and does not do them, will be likened to a foolish man who built his house on sand, and the rain descended, and the flood came, and the wind blew, and built against that house, and it fell, and great was fall. Are you noticing this? Are you noticing something here? Are you noticing something here? The Lord is making a matter very, very clear that there are people ehm, who are in the kingdom, they are in the kingdom, ehm, but they will not put his saying into practice. They will not do what he says. Ehm, these people, this set of people, they are people that are building on sand. And when you look at it very critically, do you notice that the Bible says this set of people, from, from majority of them, it is when they get to the point of no return that they will realize it. When it, it, it, I hope you get the point I'm making. When they get to the point of no return, at the point when they will say, I cast out this in your name, I did that in your name, I did this in your name, say then look, I don't know you, you workers of iniquity. Now, you can see that, ehm, the statement I said I normally make from this place, it is a glorious thing, ehm, to endure, and endure, to eventually succeed. Than, to succeed, and succeed, to eventually fail. My prayer is that, you will endure, and endure, to eventually succeed, in the name of Jesus. You will endure, and endure, to eventually succeed. That is the correct pattern. It is a wrong pattern, to succeed, and succeed, to eventually fail. And so, that is what I am bringing from that place. Eh, let us make up our mind. Eh, as long as you try to save your life, eh, you have also reached your destination. Your destination is that, as long as you try to save your life, you will definitely lose it. That is the destination. As long as you are interested in your interest, you want to protect your interest, you want to protect this, no, this is my right, this is my deed, as long as you want to do that, then, definitely, eh, the Bible says, it is going to come to pass, that every such person, they are going to lose it. Whereas, on the other hand, every person, who loses his life, will definitely, save it. And so, these are very very, these are very very, they are very very crucial to him, for us, as believers, to call our attention to. You know, to call our attention to. Because, eh, it is not just that, we believe, that is true, we believe, which is good, but beyond that we believe, is that we must be obedient. Eh, he said, anyone, who desires to save his life, will lose it. And, if you have lost your life, look at what the Bible now says, it says, for what profit is it, for a man, if he gains the old world, and himself destroyed, or, lost. So, is that the point it is making? Eh, if you will not deny yourself, if you will not choose to suffer for Christ, if you will not choose to go the way, of suffering because of godliness, eh, and so, after the war, what happened? You were able to gain the old world. What did the Bible say you have gained? Eh, you have gained, nothing. You have gained nothing. So, the point I am making, I am making, I am making, I want it to be very very clear, this evening, is that we must realize, that it is given to us in Christ, not only, not only, to believe in him, but also, to suffer, you know, for his sake. And, honestly, the matter did not end, did not end in that place. The matter did not end there. When you look into scripture, it was, it was, it was something that, the Bible repeats, in several, you know, several places. Eh, so that, we can get the, the message, very very clear. Look at, 1 Timothy chapter 4, verse 10. 1 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 10. 1 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 10. 1 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 10. 1 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 10. Because if you are there before me, please, you can read. 1 Timothy 4, is anybody there before me? Okay. This is why, we want, we want, this is why we work hard, and continue to struggle. Our hope is in the living God. Our hope is in the living God. The saviour of all the people. The saviour of all the people. You see that? You see, for, for, for therefore, we both labor, and suffer the push. Because we trust in the living God, who is the saviour of all men, especially of those who believe. You know? Huh? You can see these people talking about suffering. Suffering the push. Suffering the push. Let's look at, let's look at, 2 Timothy. 2 Timothy. Please, I want us to open in advance. Because we, we really, plenty, you know, a little, plenty scriptures, today. 2 Timothy, 2 Timothy, 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 12. 2 Timothy chapter 2 verse 9. 1 Timothy 12. Are you seeing that? What is, what is Paul suffering here? Huh? Imprisonment. They were talking about their fate. Huh? Instead of talking about being imprisoned, being imprisoned. Huh? He said, but it is nothing to him. Huh? Because it is working for him, a far greater glory. Can we look at 2 Timothy chapter 2 verse 9? 2 verse 9. For which I suffer trouble. That is the preaching of the gospel. Being, wanting to live a godly life. For which I suffer trouble, as, maybe to get it clear, please, take it from verse 7. Yes. Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead, according to the gospel. Do you see that? What was he suffering for? He was preaching that word. Jesus Christ, huh? The cross of Jesus, is the only place of salvation. We don't need any other thing in addition. So we are adding circumcision. We are adding sabbath. We are adding a lot of things. But Paul insisted, anything outside being complete in Jesus is nonsense. For that cause, he was suffering. To the point of shame. Even to the point of shame. But the word of God is not shame. But the word of God is not shame. Huh? We are looking at, let him deny himself. Huh? What I am trying to make you see, Huh? This is what I am trying to make you see. Huh? That, please, suffering, suffering for Jesus, Huh? Was, is actually the mark, of what? If you look at this now, we are still reading. Huh? That is the mark, of being, a what? A hero. When you are looking for heroes, people who don't suffer for Jesus, they are not heroes. Heroism, is suffering for Jesus. And this is, this is something today that, our generation, you know what our generation is making, suffering to look like? Huh? They are making it a shame. Paul said, for which I suffer imprisonment. But what? I am not ashamed. You know what he is trying to say? Please, how do, how do you see it? Let's look at it better. They took some elders, Peter and John. These are married men. These are fathers. Huh? Publicly, they took care. Huh? Gave them lashes. And when they were through with that, Ah! They were rejoicing. Thank you Jesus. Huh? They suffered for Jesus. Now, but we know, ordinarily that thing is shameful. Is it not shameful? Is it not shameful? It is shameful. You know? But, do you know that the reason why the pain, and the shame, was nothing, was that this people understood, what? That suffering for Christ, is not suffering but privilege and honor. So being, what makes us heroes, is suffering for Him. We are suffering for Him like this. Ah! It is to be needed. Yes! Me to have received the mark of what? Heroism. That is the mark of being heroes. Unfortunately today, it is the mark, today of being stupid. It is the mark of not being smart. It is the mark, eh? Of not being wise. You know what it means to be wise? Eh? It is to live godliness, tell one lie to escape suffering. What it means to be smart? Eh? Eh? It is to, it is to, it is to tell official lie, diplomatic lies, live double standard, live double lie. Eh? Get along, with the majority, so that they don't call you names. That is what it means to be smart today. But, what it means to be smart? What it means to be, what it means to be, to be, hero? What is it? It is to be what? It is to suffer for Christ. That is what it means to be, to be, eh? Yes! We now have heroes. And, it is in suffering. Eh? So, you notice that, I am not ashamed. Our generation, is making suffering, for godliness, a shame. We don't make people, we don't celebrate people again. We suffer for godliness. You know what we say? Eh? Allah said you there. Eh? Mister know too much. Mister too know. Eh? Mister, Mister, eh, eh, eh, eh, only him is righteous. We call, in fact, we, I am talking of what believers we be calling believers. I am not talking of what the world is calling believers. I am talking of what fellow believers we say. We will say, I enter into the exam, and I could not understand anything. I tell you, you don't understand. So, I just left the exam. I will carry the course. To them, ah, you mean you did what? So, you could not just ask somebody what was the answer. I don't know whether, whether you are, you are understanding me. How will you, how will you take them? They are looking for somebody that is not up to thirty-five. How will you tell him that you are thirty-six? So, if you don't tell him that you are thirty-four, and then you make it up to thirty-five, you say it's not just number. That is why you will not get job. You will be doing all this minutely. That is what you will see a fellow believer telling you. Nobody wants to celebrate you. That you are suffering for godliness. You are not to be celebrated. What I am trying to say, I am talking of what more generally happens. Eh? Celebrating people who suffer godliness today. Eh? It becomes a part of your life. It becomes a part of your life. It becomes not the common thing. It becomes the awkward thing. That is what I am saying. The awkward thing. Why do you have to tell them that truth? Is it not Nigeria? It does not do anything you should have. I am telling you. The way you are going like this, you will not get promotion. You will not get promotion. The way you are going like this, you will not make it up. You think you will ever get contract in Nigeria? You will never get contract the way you are going. You know, I am just using different job situations to explain the reality of our day. Enduring, being tormented, suffering is all. They will waste your time. Don't let them waste your time. Just do whatever they want you to do. The same with the Lord who helped us in the name of Jesus. But we are looking at let Him deny himself. Let Him deny himself. We must lose sight of our self. Today, we are not losing sight of our self. We are not losing sight of our on benefit. He says if we suffer we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he will deny us. If we suffer we will also reign with him. But if we deny him he will deny us. If you look at 2 Timothy 3 12, he says yes all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall do what? Suffer. Anybody who will not lose sight of himself cannot follow Jesus. Cannot be godly. If you will not forget your interest. And it was this scripture I was showing somebody even when it comes to look at how the bible put it in 1st Peter 1st Peter chapter 2 I won't go to get it out I will try to put it back in the next 5-6 minutes so that we can pray. I won't go to get to that scripture quickly. To that scripture quickly. Even though I will see how we amplify this more and more next week. This matter of suffering let him deny himself. Let's look at that 1st Peter 1st Peter chapter 2 1st Peter chapter 2 1st Peter 2 1st Peter 2 Are you there? 1st Peter 2 Now look at what the bible says I want to take it so that it can be clear it can be clear because sometimes people take this thing out of context I read from verse 11 1st Peter 2 from verse 11 it says Beloved I beg you Is it the matter of beg again? Verse we left last week I beg you as sojourners Who is a sojourner? Who is a sojourner? A traveler one I wonder where I am looking at a sojourner I wonder where I am looking at a sojourner A a a a a a a a a a a a a is a foreigner a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a we are temporal residents we are temporal residents we are just temporal residents you see we must remember I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims abstain from what? Fleshly laws which war against the soul what's the next thing? what are we to do? having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles that when they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they observe glorify God in the day of visitation I'm telling you there is a there is a situation people don't know if you continue godly just like I gave you to look at this dirty example just came to my head now look at where EJ has gone and what he took over there as ministerialist of the state I hope you remember that was December December December 31st 1983 when the Shagali government was ousted and then you have today for 19 into 84 84 and then by 85 you know government to take over now if you remember that when they took over they were going to throw governors into the world into life imprisonment life imprisonment but when they got to Baba Yashin what did they tell him they said Baba we respect you sir you can be going home that's a day of visitation that's a day of visitation it was they glorified him in the day of what visitation what you don't understand is this the bible normally says very clearly he said a thousand will fall to your side when does your right hand side only with your eye it will not come near you only with your eye will you do what so what is that scripture saying it means when visitation comes for the wicked the reason why you did not fall is because you did not do wickedly because there is a deal of visitation come back come out there is visitation so when someone complete things will happen it could bring life it could bring death and that is the mistake some of us normally make the rich fool the rich man and Lazarus did not see visitation eh until he died so some people they have seen eh comes where he comes after them he comes after them so people they will die in peace in fact people will be praying make my life be like their own but by the time they open their eternity for you and you see them in hellfire you will be wondering but some people their visitation is where their sin goes before them you will see their punishment here eh so when he is talking about visitation he is talking about people whose their sin goes before them their wickedness goes before them the same thing with good works some people their reward eh comes behind them it is an eternity look at Lazarus eh he looks like that man eh he gains nothing but was that the reality of it no because his reward went where it was going behind him it was going behind him eh but for somebody like Job somebody like Job where was his reward his reward was before him but we say God gave him eh God gave him life twice everything that he has so some people it is before some people it is behind what Peter was talking about here is that there is eternity of visitation some people eh their righteousness will come forth like noonday God will magnify them before everybody who has persecuted them that they will bite their finger like the case of Joseph his brothers were biting their finger eh it was the day of visitation they glorified God God was glorified in him was God not glorified God was glorified in him that's what you must understand you see you know visitation you know you know don't go with but what I want you to see is that having your conduct how honorable among Gentiles we are not to live like Gentiles we are to live for the Lord eh look at the next thing he said therefore submit yourself to every ordinances of man for the Lord's sake whether to the king as supreme or to governors as to those who were sent by him and for the praise of those who do good for this is the will of God please listen for this is the will of God that by doing good you may prove to silence what the ignorance of foolish men one thing you don't understand brethren the only way eh eh or one of the critical ways to put to to silence the ignorance of foolish men eh is to deny ourselves and live for Jesus it is because we are not denying ourselves today we are not living honorably they tell you eh you are driving somebody say hey you stupid person you too reply you are mad yourself so how did you put to silence your foolishness they are keeping malice they didn't greet you you too are keeping malice you didn't greet them you start to look like greeting the answer me so how you put to how you how you live honorably you are remembering yourself you are trying to you are trying to give them back you are trying to show it I will put the matter from here in next week for today let us pray eh let him deny himself let him deny himself let him deny himself that's the matter we are we are concentrating eh we are looking at it the other dimension to this matter eh you know the other side the side of suffering the side of prepare your minds to suffer for Jesus that is what is meant to deny yourself have a prepared mind and understand that suffering for Jesus is nothing it is honor and privilege that is what it is To deny ourselves Have this kind of mind I want you to talk to the Lord I want you to talk to the Lord How? Are you living honorably among the Gentiles? Are you living honorably? Or your life Your life cannot To silence their foolishness Because you too you are foolish You live like them You take malice like them You fight like them You talk like them You react like them You steal like them You lie like them You are not different You compromise like them You do everything like them Then later you not carry the Bible For God so loved the world Which stupid Christian are you preaching? When your life could not silence their foolishness You see your world that want to silence their foolishness Can you give what you don't have? Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord we pray As we We keep considering this matter of your cross Our place What you have done And our place in this cross This matter of The This old rugged cross The emblem of what it is What it stands for Lord we pray May our life be correct May our life be correct May our life be right Lord May we not May we not May we not build and build And build to eventually fail In the name of Jesus Lord God Almighty May we be that at last Oh God It is the song of victory In the name of Jesus Lord help us Help us that our perception Of the cross May be correct Our relationship to the cross Be correct May it be right In the Jesus Thank you Eternal Father Blessed be your holy name Our God In Jesus name We pray Amen The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ The love of God And the fellowship of the Holy Spirit Be with us now And forevermore Amen This message is coming to you From Family Tenth Ministry A Christian ministry Involving enriching the lives Of singles and married Through preaching and teaching Of God's word Discipleship, family life enrichment Social And community development And mission hate Our regular activities Are Discipleship class Every Monday 5pm Adolescent and singles club Every first Saturday Of every month At 10am Marriage forum Second Saturday Of every month At 10am Family life seminars Regular school outreaches And everyday counseling For further counseling You can reach us at our location LifeCamp by the first bridge Family life seminar at the first bridge Iliwe community Opposite the Rejoy filling station Along Ijare road Akure Undo State, Nigeria You can also reach us through our Social media handles FamilyTenth at yahoo.co.uk FamilyTenth Ministry Ho1Hijimi.com www.FamilyTenthMinistry.org Our phone numbers are 080 3386 11186 1136 07033613848 God bless you all\"}\n",

God greatly desires a godly home for us. These are words of restoration and instruction and righteousness from family to ministry. May ye be blessed as you listen. Because he want to use us to display what is holiness. He want to show that it is possible for human beings to live holy life. That's why he chose us. He want to demonstrate to the devil. He want to demonstrate to men. He want to demonstrate to principalities and powers. He want to demonstrate to rulers of darkness. He want to demonstrate. To spiritual wickedness in heavenly places. That mere men, mortal men, mortal men can be here on this planet earth. Where sin came? Where the devil came to disrupt the plan of God? To disrupt it. Thinking that yes, he has done the... He has done the... He has done the... He has done his worst. But here God want to show that look. Ever before you even... It came to your mind that you are going to disrupt my plan. My plan was never disrupted. Because ever before the world was, the lamb had been slain. And men has been chosen. And those men will display holiness. On this planet earth. And so, we said, primarily, one thing that should readily characterize a born again believer is what? Holiness. That is it. Because that was why they were, you know, they were chosen. That is the reason. He said in that verse 4, that just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless. And I concluded last week by making us to read the book of Titus. Just trying to recap a little before we move on today. In Titus 2, Titus 2, 11. 2, 11 to verse 14. That was where we stopped last week. What did we see there? The Bible says, For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men. And what is that grace doing? It's teaching us. What does it mean to teach? What does it mean to teach? People that are teachers. What does it mean to teach? Huh? What does it mean to teach? People that are teachers. What does it mean to teach? Huh? To impart knowledge. Is that all about teaching? Is it to just impart knowledge? We instruct. That is true. Okay? We instruct. we impart knowledge what else is in teaching to yes we guide workers is in teaching work is the ultimate purpose for teaching I'm going to find this of us that are teachers so if we don't get the correct answer what is us teaching those of us that are businessmen and engineers who may not be able to tell us what is the purpose of teaching so I will not blame those of us that are not in teaching professional teaching professional but also that are teachers the ultimate purpose of teaching is that the person who is taught will be like the teacher do you get it do you get it at all so that for example if I'm taking somebody to drive after some time the person should be able to do what drive I will guide I will instruct I will impart knowledge and ultimately I will cause the person to know and be able to do if I say I'm teaching you to drive and after three years you still cannot drive what do you do describe me as you say I'm a bad teacher or it's a bad student because the ultimate purpose of teaching is that the person should be able to do that which he or she was taught do you get it now the Holy Spirit look at what Grace is doing by the work of the Holy Spirit I would say for the grace of God that brings salvation as what appeared to who to all men now when this grace appeared what is Grace doing what is the grace doing so what are the things that the gates let us not mention them Grace will be guiding us is that not true is that not true will be giving us instruction is that not true number three we be imparting knowledge is that not true that's true we'll be doing what again we'll be making us to know he said that grace is a bad teacher or we did not experience grace that appeared when we say salvation has appeared you will know that the bible is not saying that grace he does something the bible is making us to see that actually grace is a person since grace is a teacher so when the bible says grace has appeared in the real sense of it what is that we say jesus appeared when he was doing what did he do he gave us another teacher was with the disciples that is how the holy spirit is with us today the bible said the grace has appeared the bible is talking about the fact that by the death and the resurrection of jesus christ and there is a working of the holy spirit and to guide us to do what again and to give us instruction to do what again to impart knowledge to do what again to cause us to know and be able to to do that is causing us to know and be able to do look at it what is the first thing it says denying ungodliness can read it under translation but when we say denying on godliness it may not be very clear what you did not do to them he asked what he asked you to do and how did you ask him so what какие what is that translation in the hall or maybe i should open other translations from here let's see other translations of that matter or that translation of that titus 2 verse 11. i'm trying to move further from where because i stopped last week i want to move further from there and i'm moving further from that point that was the scripture i read last week and i want to dwell on that scripture to establish the fact that if on a daily basis you are not growing in holiness can i announce to you it is possible that you are a child of perdition because was with grace but you never agree that's around grace jesus was with grace all the teaching of grace everything was going on you just remain a chief you never agree to investigate your life that i'm not sure i'm not a son of perdition truly say king of god see how will i put it that's working of god that is about us it is some edition of the world so it is something that god is doing that says again the bible says he who began the good work in you is able to do what to finish it it is a work that god began because jesus spoke about the disciples he said of all that you have given me i've lost none judas that was lost was never given he was just there but he was not given you need to check this work of god phone is something we are coming to heaven matter we'll soon get to the matter of heaven but i'm talking about the matter of holiness and blamelessness it is something it is a blessing that is settled in heaven in with us i don't know how to put it okay let me put it this way oh i'm looking for a perfect example so make you understand this thing good bilding is thirty five or one thousand yeah not two you know to not contain that thing then what i'll be coming out because of right hand water to water there is this water that came before a source before that source was muddy water so for many years that water was passing through the pipe after several years of that thing begin to stay inside the pipe stay inside the pipe stay inside the pipe stay inside the pipe is that not true you know it will not contain that thing then water will be coming out becauseawcacles at the pipe has ended up not to so that water would be opening because of water will 물�ing of the water coming from that pipe into the water so that it was pintering for water and then in the water that pipe started water water and the water was that water that was flowing through it is that not now if you now go to the source you unplug that pipe from that dirty water you now plug the pipe to a clean crystal water you now plug it to it and you wanna begin to flow what will be coming out of the pipe dirty water water i mean and those particular two will be coming out sometimes that's why to the clean one at the point of the source it has become clean over time over time over time over time after some years will be what with a clean and water coming out will be clean what i'm saying is that when we became born again we must understand that our source was changed water was now connected we must find water a clean pipe and clean water somebody says a clean water has been has been connected and nothing nothing is coming up continue to flow dirty water dirty water dirty water dirty water for years dirty water and the person is saying that you see i'm trusting god for grace and god the grace of god will help me the grace of god will help me please are you understanding me the problem may be that that pipe was not verse 17 yes do you get that at all what could the bible say what about saying in that verse okay in an lc okay let's have it tonight now see let's see okay what could that be trying to say brethren let's look at three things actually that three things that scripture is saying number one what can you sign to say one jesus is greater than adam yes what else again can we see came to one man and everybody died to that one man then since jesus is greater than adam then grace will reign greater from that one man to everybody is that not is that not what he thought there are three things there and we have looked at that much more that's what you're saying that's the second one that i got next we raise just the way sin reign but there's something there it means one thing in that verse and yes there's something about that grace what do you say about that grace look at it the grace and the righteousness are you getting what are they no do you notice that he says that the grace is already received not that it will be received do you notice it do you notice that that the grace is what already received he said those who receive grace not that they will be received but they receive the grace then true the righteousness i want to reign is this something they will receive or that they have received received it and righteousness are things we received why because god was choosing us in him he chose us to be what holy and blameless experience it physically what did god do that we just were speaking about so what did he give again he gave righteousness as a what as a gift your life is not righteous what can we say about that life saying that you say you are a believer and your life is not daily changing to be holy and blameless and changing from glory to glory you need to check you may be a son of perdition something of it's not something of chance quickly working on how to achieve his purpose and i'm telling you that is what god did that is what jesus christ could say confidently i know what he said you know what he said he said you know what he said he said no one eh can pluck them out of my hand for the father who gave them to me is greater than me and no one can pluck them out of my father's hand in order to say all that the father has given me this is the will of the father that i should raise them up on the last day should raise them that god just left us and we are just struggling no it is what is working in us the good work is able to finish it because when he chose us he actually chose us to be what holy and blameless we must properly understand it to us and chapter 4 eh you will understand why paul is saying that eh put off the old man and all is this put on the new man that is renewed after this what are children of life that you have received not what you will receive kind of ourselves do is a product of setting you free what was done who you are thinking you might be thinking that nobody is living a upright life because you are a compromiser and people around you are not different from you you will be surprised you know i love this example and i keep giving it everybody saw the high priest the levi's the royal people bowing down to the image of nekavneza you'll be thinking will be nobody that will not bow that is the maxi expectation of creation to waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god and i'm telling you why you will be thinking please listen to me i'm not sure i'm not showing you a mystery but i'm telling you a truth when the bible says the creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god you'll be thinking that one day eh no sorry that's not it the truth is that eh that manifestation that we will see is actually a process that started some times back in the life of some people but you did not key into did you understand me did you understand me let me explain it again let me use biblical things to illustrate it when they released him the servants will go and kill him and all of that thinking it was that day that God raised David it was not that day that God raised David God had been working on the life of David while others were sleeping you're saying that's not it that's not it that's not it that's not it that's not it that's not it that's not it now eh that boy was with the sheep God has been using lion and bear to train the boy to train him God has been using catapults to train the boy the boy was going through training he was understanding God God can deliver from anything he has been having that understanding he has been going that understanding until one day one small boy just came out I said who is this boy what does he know what does he understand manifestation let me tell you will not be a sudden thing it will be in the life of men that God has been working upon before the day of manifestation put up at the age of 30. did the work for three and a half years but for the first one to 29 years where was he was he just not 30 years that he just jumped down from heaven and then just started no no says that we are waiting for this song you need to understand that if you are not daily changing where you are may I announce to you maybe you are a Vagabond to God's program a wanderer they will be calling you sis they will be calling you bro but you are a wanderer that prodigal son carried all the weight of his father huh and I see him they were celebrating him but back at home huh they were looking for him so you may be celebrating some people you may be calling them bro and sis but actually huh they are just wonderers they are vagabonds huh if you reduce manifestation that will prove it that's what you say you are the one who taught huh you don't have to say exactly how it happened with Judas you went with the 12th mission of the 12th you know it went mission of the 17th what happened you know it went huh put at the point huh Jesus was arranging his final living was he not there as there is a particle of that will that they want to share but it was the day of manifestation that showed that it was not to say if correctly because they are not struggling according to knowledge I don't know how you understand me live only when you realize that you have been made only I like that righteousness has been given to you as a gift as if you're ungodly you die remain ungodly what what do I have to do with ungodliness what one coming from what coming from what coming from an understanding unto Jesus the venom of the serpent we watch we die that is what it is please I want to move further I want to move further in that scripture let's move further so that in Romans chapter 5 um these things have been given it has been given and we need to know that we need to clarify that which has been given now in in efficiency one again we move on look at what the bible says look how the bible says in verse five eh hallelujah hallelujah look at what the bible says in verse five my translation says we will try we will try my translation says heaven predestined us to adoption as sons by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will hallelujah predestinated us to adoption as son by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to adopt us into his own family to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through jesus christ by bringing us to himself through jesus christ this is what he wanted to do and it gave him great pleasure do you get that this is what is what and what do you understand that do you understand that decided in advance hallelujah dead in advance to bring us to incest through jesus christ now listening this is what he wanted to do and it gave him pleasure do you understand that know what the bible is saying he's saying that i'm blameless in christ and something that god decided to do in advance and it gave him pleasure you know what he's trying to say he's trying to say that it was not we that loved him not we that loved him no it was the other way round what was the other way round loved us so himself and that is what gave him pleasure maybe i should explain this using a biblical example i want god wanted to save israel through gideon eh it was god's decision to save israel it was god it was god good pleasure to do so was that not was that not god came down to deliver them and god himself wanted to fight the battle and so when they came and they came in their numbers god said no they go to the battle like this and they fight they will not realize that what it was god that forced the battle so the best thing to do is what to do the number so that they will know that it is me what was god looking for we're looking for glory now when he says god decided in advance to bring us to himself and it gave him pleasure you understand it now you understand it now that is making god happy about this whole thing what is making god feel good and cool about it is that everything about your salvation is about him so when you get that about your salvation is about who it's about him you want to take glory to the end of your life then you want to take glory to the end of your life glory at all eh it is to be godless god resists the proud as something in titus look at something again in tight i want us to go to titus look at status titus chapter three titus chapter three are you there are you there i will read from the energy translation because i want to get at something i'm reading from verse one look at what the bible says remind the believers to submit to the government and its officers they should be obedient always ready to do what is good they must not slander anyone and must avoid quarreling instead they should be gentle and show true humility to everyone why why you say once we too were what disobedient we we were misled and became slaves to many lusts and pleasure our lives were full of evil and envy and we ate each other but when god our savior revealed his kindness and love he saved us not because of the righteous things we add but because of his mercy he washed us from Canada we saved our rights Dies Resultatum fijDI Laud Brusque He drived the超 because of his mercy died because of his mercy away our sin giving us a new birth and new life through the holy spirit he generously poured out the holy spirit upon us through jesus christ because of his grace he declared us righteous and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life do you get something do you get something what is the time to say yes what is i telling them don't fight anybody don't fight unbelievers be gentle towards them be disordered don't do anything because why we were we ourselves were not different how did the difference between we and them how did it come to escape when god kindness appeared it was not when we decided to change god pleasure what is giving god pleasure hey is that if anybody want to boast hey it should not be before god meaning pleasure is that a milo it is about me i i showed you something last week hey that if anybody want to glory what does god want no no no no no first of all you have read last week he said so that he said please let's let's let's see that situation let's see that scripture again let's see that scripture let's go there quickly let's see that first one chapter one first one seems one first one chance one are you there first one chapter one are you there look at where we read last week he said um um sorry let me take it from the verse let me take it from the verse 26 remember dear brothers and sisters that few of you were wise in the world in the eyes of the world or powerful or worthy when god called you he said god chose things that the world considered foolish in order to shame those whom the world think they are what they are wise he shows the things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful god chose things despised by the world this counted as nothing at all he chose the things despite by the world this is counted as nothing at all and use them to bring to nothing what the word considered important as a result no one can what no one can what ever boast in the presence of god therefore the scripture says if you want to boast boast only about the lord do you get it you see you need to understand something you see these are things that if you don't understand uh when it comes to living the godly life eh you are you will not be able to live correctly until you understand this eternal truth the truth about your salvation is that it was what god decided in advance to bring you to himself through jesus christ and he did that eh not because you decided to come but he did that because he decided to come to you i want you to know this eh to achieve some things in god you will be able to tell the thing that you need to understand eh that my victory is not based on my ability my victory of the ability of god forget it please get this what's guaranteed that didion will win the battle was not the 300 men in your sense i'm talking about living your life you begin to consider admitted to look at yourself the more you look at yourself the more you're not able to live right you see it's an understanding you must receive in the life of god you must look away from what from who you are and your ability you must notice this let me tell you something the more you look at yourself the more you look at your inability the more you look at your situation you know what to be happening to you and you will be doubting the the possibility of living right and you know the problem you know the problem the problem is that that's your doubt is the very reason why the power of god cannot work in your life because without faith it is impossible to please god woman with the issue of blood keep looking at her records she will not take step for a healing god wants you to know is that see the matter of your salvation in bringing you to me what gives me pleasure is that i decided in advance he did it in advance before you began to it was something he accomplished in himself it was his own decision it was his decision you need to remind yourself hey that he shall you want me i'm god and work i and the bible says you are the workmanship of god and created in who in christ i am god and work something that god is working on i am god and work i need to save my self i have the savior i have a lord i have a god i have a redeemer i have i don't understand me and that person is the person that is changing me that is making me that is raising me from glory to glory don't pretend not to know to objection or something like i'm going to get rid of his wheel to the prayers of the god of oh you know of his grace he made us at you know accepted in the below this on that matter that at this way i want to enter this matter of accepting can we see that's another translation he said to the praise of glory of his name by which he made us accepted in the below on that translation this kingdom says accepted in the below huh that is one versus accepted in the below no ephesians 1 6 yes let's have translation let's have translation for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear son who belong to his dear son okay you put it as who belong to his dear son on that translation so that we might be to the praise and the commendation of his glorious grace favor and mercy which is so freely bestowed on us in the beloved are you getting something at all in that place huh how do i how do i explain it i'm looking for something physical for you to explain it aha i wonder if it just came to my mind now that's like i'm used to explaining it now you know the is in john chapter 3 verse 17 18. he says for the father and after i said for god to love the world that he gave his only begotten son that was if i believe it in him should not what should not perish but have what now what is the thing that followed for the father send the song into the world not to condemn the world but as was but that the world might be saved through him now look at it he will believe he will believe it's not condemned he will believe not so he now says this is the condemnation that lies light came to the world marriage so i want to ask you the fornicator what is his condemnation do you see that fornication is not why he was condemned i get something huh is that light came but the fornicator refused to believe the light are you understanding me now get it now if you have gotten that what is said in verses hey is that god is not trying to accept you because you behave right god have accepted you what are they saying of god has nothing to do with what you do or did not do god accepting you is in christ i have accepted presence huh to receive grace and find what to obtain mercy and find grace to help are you really understanding me name is that because i well i should be rounding off now i said we always finish for 6 30. you know in the old testament huh thank you in fact thank you we should we will be praying now you know the old testament huh for the high priest to come into god's presence uh he must obtain holiness so he get that holiness of his own accord he now coming into god's presence if he does not get it before he comes huh he will die at that presence do you get it around president what we are saying is this what god did in christ is that not only did god accept it but also that he must ascend cry into Christ is that not only did God save us but God gave us access to him. Do you get it at all? Eh? That's to God. Once in choosing you, you what? Access to him. You can access God. You need to fear. Not perfected in love. Yet a sinner. That is acceptance. You can come. Come. Esther wants to enter the presence of the king. She wants you to go three days fasting and prayer. So that if the king don't lift up the what we did, you know what God did. King you born again. Just the scepter is just pointed. It's not like one thing that when you now pray, no, it's just pointed. So anytime you are coming, where is the scepter? It's pointed with favor. Just come. Let him be beloved. Let him be beloved. You know Romans chapter five. Justified by faith. We have peace with God. Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Have what? To see? To access God. Then we need the intermediaries. So I want this small small God. Eh? And sometimes they tell you that there are some intermediaries in prophets. And sometimes we tell you that it's in it's in one veneration. It's in one veneration. You say, I'm a little person in Mary. Or Trump. No! The man of God to assess God. I really born again. Give me my life to Jesus. What do I have? Eh? We stop here today. We stop here today. I want you to talk to the Lord. We have access. Some things again today. Huh? That grace had been given. Righteousness had been given. Grace had been given. Righteousness had been given. Righteousness had been given. Righteousness had been given. Righteousness had been given. Righteousness had been given. Righteousness had been given. is given it is god's pleasure that everything about your salvation is about him everything it is god did it in advance we came to god when god appeared to us not when we decided to come you must understand that he appeared to you he did that in advance understand it he did it in advance he did it because he has plans he has proposed for you he has planned these are things you must understand if god has decided in advance before you came to choose you then you know that he has plans for you so i don't know understand this thing don't live your life anyhow god
